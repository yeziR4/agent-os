    The sibling of the WS handshake Origin guard (``is_allowed_ws_origin``),

    ``auth.mode="none"`` a loopback peer is admitted to Control and the
    default CORS posture (``["*"]`` + credentials) reflects any page Origin,
    so a malicious page in the victim's browser could otherwise ``fetch()``
    the same Control RPC surface the WS guard protects (``/api/config``,
    ``/api/sessions``, ``/api/chat``) and read the responses.

    Requests without an ``Origin`` header (CLI, curl, browser navigations)
    pass through untouched. A browser request carries the page origin, which
    must be loopback or explicitly allowed — ``control_ui.allowed_origins``
    or a non-wildcard ``cors.allowed_origins`` entry (deliberate operator
    intent; the wildcard default is exactly the posture this guard fences).
    On a non-loopback bind the check is a no-op, matching the WS guard: the
    gateway only starts there with enforced token authentication.

    Public paths are exempt, mirroring ``AuthMiddleware.PUBLIC_PATHS`` and the
    Control UI prefix: health probes carry no credentials and no Control surface,
    and the Control UI shell is a served page (guarded by CSP /
    ``SecurityHeadersMiddleware``), not an RPC sink. Only the ``/api/*`` and
    RPC surface — the drive-by target — is gated.

    The UI prefix exemption stops at ``{base_path}/api/`` (``_is_ui_path``
    below): the shell and its fingerprinted assets are top-level navigations
    and subresource loads, but the JSON routes mounted under the UI prefix
    (``/control/api/bootstrap``) are fetch-only and therefore exactly the
    drive-by target this guard exists for — with ``cors.allowed_origins``
    defaulting to ``["*"]``, any page the operator visits could read the
