gmgn-wallet-analysis — the four-gate wallet dossier.

Answers one question: "this wallet's numbers look good — should I actually copy it,
and if I do, what happens to me?"

Four gates, each pass/fail, each with the number that decided it:
  G1 AUTHENTICITY  is the record real, or one lucky coin / a dev marking its own homework?
  G2 CURRENCY      is the edge still working THIS week, or is the good number historical?
  G3 REACHABILITY  can you actually get filled — copy window, entry band, trade size?
  G4 SURVIVABILITY does it cut losses, or does it ride things to zero and take you along?

Verdict is a function of the gates, not a black-box score.

# English is the source of truth: every user-facing string in this file is written in
# English, and the `ZH` table below maps an English template to its translation. A key that
# is missing from the table falls back to English, which is always a correct answer — so a
# partial translation degrades into mixed language, never into a crash or a blank line.
#
# Templates use positional placeholders (`{0}`, `{1}`) rather than named ones, because the
# same value often reads in a different position in another language and the translator
# needs to be able to move it.

# ─── style layer: main title + speed subtitle ────────────────────────────────
# Merged in from the wallet-style testbench. Four deliberate changes were made on the
# way in, each because the original mis-labelled a wallet we had already verified:
#   1. No "officially verified" badge. It fired on any non-empty `common.tags`, so it printed
#      `wash_trader` under a commendation glyph. Tags go through TAGS/severity instead.
#   2. The speed subtitle reads the MEDIAN copy window, not `avg_holding_period`. The
#      mean counts bags never sold, so it called a 2-minute scalper a 1-7 day swing trader.
#   3. P5 needs ROI > 50% plus ONE of {win rate ≥ 50%, heavy-loss share < 15%}, not all
#      three. Memecoin P&L is low-hit-rate with a fat right tail; requiring 50% win rate
#      pushed a wallet sitting at #3 on GMGN's own 7D leaderboard down to P4.
#   4. Activity-derived badges are gated on sample size (see top3_buy_share / hour_peak).
# The `token_num >= 5` floor on P5 is kept as-is: one lucky coin must not score "one-shot".
