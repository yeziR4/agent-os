"""Apply cell edits to an existing `.xlsx`.

Operations:
    {"op": "set_cell", "sheet": "Q3", "row": 1, "col": 1, "value": "..."}
    {"op": "set_cell", "sheet": "Q3", "row": 2, "col": 2, "value": "=SUM(B3:B10)"}
    {"op": "set_cell", "sheet": "Q3", "row": 3, "col": 3, "value": "=hello", "as_text": true}
    {"op": "set_cell", "sheet": "Q3", "row": 4, "col": 1, "value": null}
    {"op": "rename_sheet", "old": "Sheet1", "new": "Summary"}
    {"op": "merge_cells", "sheet": "Q3", "range": "A1:C1"}

`value` semantics for `set_cell`:

* An explicit ``null`` **clears** the cell. It is the only way to express that
  in this op schema, and the cell's style is left alone.
* A **missing** ``value`` key is a malformed operation: it is skipped and not
  counted in ``applied``, so a typo cannot silently wipe data.
* ``0``, ``false`` and ``""`` are values, not absence, and are written as given.

`merge_cells` skips a range that overlaps a merge already on the sheet --
whether that merge was already there or was added earlier in this same op
list -- and does not count it in ``applied``. openpyxl does not reject an
overlapping merge itself: it adds both ranges to the sheet and blanks every
non-top-left cell each one covers, so the second merge silently discards
whatever value sat in the cells it shares with the first, and the workbook
ends up with two merged ranges that share cells, which Excel treats as
corrupt. Refusing the op is what keeps ``applied`` a count of edits that
actually landed cleanly.
