# Changelog

All notable changes to AgentOS will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `http_request`'s `AGENTOS_HTTP_DOWNLOAD_LIMIT` override treated any
  configured value below one stream chunk (65,536 bytes) the same as an
  unparseable one, silently discarding it and falling back to the full
  1,000,000-byte default — up to 20x more than the operator configured, with
  nothing logged. A sub-chunk value is now floored at the chunk size instead
  of being thrown away.

## [2026.9.16] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- `apply_patch` spliced each hunk by the length of its header context and
  then rebuilt the tail from the body, so a hunk whose body consumed a
  different number of lines than the header declared duplicated or dropped
  the lines after it; hunks now splice by what the body actually consumed
  ([#2224](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/2224)). A patch
  whose last context line had no trailing newline was joined onto the next
  line instead of ending there
  ([#1907](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1907)).
- `edit_file` and `write_file` rewrote a CRLF file with LF line endings on
  every edit; both now preserve the file's existing line-ending style
  ([#1909](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1909)).
- `git_diff` diffed the working tree against the index, so staged work was
  reported as "no changes"; it now diffs against `HEAD`
  ([#1963](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1963)).
- `glob_search` and `grep_search` returned an empty result for a base path
  that does not exist instead of saying so
  ([#1802](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1802)).
- `config_get` reported a configured key as missing when its value was
  `null`; the key is now returned with its null value
  ([#1892](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1892)).
- `subagents list` ignored its `spawned_by` filter and returned every
  subagent ([#1799](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1799)).
- The env-dump redaction gate only recognised `;`, `&&` and `|` as command
  separators, so `env` on its own line after another command escaped
  redaction; a newline is now a separator too
  ([#1721](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1721)).
- Artifact publishing: the in-turn file authoring dedupe matched on bytes
  alone, so two attachments with identical content but different names or
  MIME types collapsed into one
  ([#1836](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1836)); the same
  bytes-only identity let a published artifact shadow a differently-named
  one ([#1793](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1793)); and the
  auto-publish mention matcher fired on any substring, so a reply mentioning
  `report.pdf.bak` published `report.pdf` -- a filename boundary is now
  required ([#1978](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1978)).
- Channels: `SlackChannel.send()` posted an oversized final reply in one
  message and lost it to Slack's length limit; it now chunks through the
  shared fence-aware splitter like Telegram and Discord already did
  ([#2236](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/2236)). Slack
  message deletes and Discord edits/deletes resolved against the adapter's
  most recent conversation rather than the message's own channel
  ([#1807](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1807),
  [#1883](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1883)); the
  Microsoft Teams proactive-send fallback likewise targeted whoever spoke
  last ([#1789](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1789)). The
  Telegram renderer truncated a link destination at its first `)` even when
  the parentheses were balanced, and only recognised a fence info string of
  `[a-z]+`, so ```` ```c++ ```` or ```` ```objective-c ```` rendered as
  literal text ([#2003](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/2003)).
  The channel `RateLimiter` did not advance its refill clock across a wait,
  so the first request after a stall was charged twice
  ([#1876](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1876)).
- Providers: an Anthropic `404` and any provider's "model unavailable"
  response are classified as `MODEL_NOT_FOUND` so the router falls through to
  the next tier instead of retrying a model that does not exist
  ([#2234](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/2234),
  [#1359](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1359)). Ollama tool
  calls with empty `arguments` or a `null` details block no longer crash the
  turn -- empty arguments are read as `{}`
  ([#1950](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1950)).
  `get_capabilities` matched provider branches case-sensitively, so
  `Anthropic` fell through to the generic defaults
  ([#1899](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1899)).
- Scheduler: cancelling a cron job neither killed nor reaped its script
  subprocess, leaving it running to completion and a zombie behind
  ([#1949](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1949)); a cron
  runtime turn kept running after its handler was cancelled
  ([#1948](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1948)); and a
  relative `workdir` resolved against the gateway's CWD instead of the cron
  script's own directory
  ([#1911](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1911)).
  `cron-watchers` treated an empty watermark as "never ran" and re-delivered
  everything, and could report one id twice in a single poll
  ([#1946](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1946)).
- Gateway and sessions: a turn whose start-up failed never released its
  concurrency slot, so enough failures pinned the session at its limit
  ([#1984](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1984)); a
  session's locks could be evicted from the bounded registry while its turns
  were still in flight, letting a second turn run unserialised
  ([#1965](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1965)).
  `ApprovalQueue` never reaped an approval that expired with no waiter and
  never pruned resolved rows, so the table grew without bound
  ([#1987](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1987)).
  `TaskRuntime.list()` took its window from the oldest tasks, so the tasks
  an operator actually cares about were the ones truncated
  ([#1805](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1805)).
  `display_name` was normalised only at the RPC boundary, so a direct
  `SessionManager` caller could store a padded or empty name
  ([#1973](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1973)), and
  `search_transcript`'s session filter matched the id but not the session
  key ([#1801](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1801)).
- Engine and MCP: the protocol-leak guard flushed its buffer only on a clean
  stream end, so a stream error dropped the text it was holding
  ([#1796](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1796));
  `events_wait` reported a timeout when its internal poll expired rather than
  the caller's deadline
  ([#1798](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1798)).
- Memory: `memory_delete` did not notify `on_memory_write`, so the snapshot
  kept serving the deleted entry
  ([#1806](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1806)); a path
  ingest indexed the content but never persisted it into `knowledge_base/`,
  leaving a ghost index that pointed at nothing after restart -- ingest of
  the workspace root or an absolute path outside it is now refused
  ([#2365](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/2365)).
- Memory redaction recognised `secret`, `token` and `password` as key
  qualifiers but not `signing`, `encryption` or `account`, so
  `signing_key` and `account_key` leaked
  ([#1901](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1901)); the name
  splitter did not separate an all-caps acronym from the word after it, so
  `APIKey`-style identifiers were left unmasked
  ([#2007](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/2007)).
- CLI: `agentos sessions list` widened its fetch window only for `--search`,
  so any other filter was applied to a truncated page and silently dropped
  matches ([#1913](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1913));
  gateway client events were not correlated to the turn in flight
  ([#1790](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1790)).
- `pdf` tool: a page range that names the same page twice (`1-3,2`) no longer
  extracts it twice, which duplicated the text and charged the duplicate
  against the page budget
  ([#2229](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/2229)).
- `pdf-toolkit`: `merge.py` and `split.py` silently contributed fewer pages
  -- or none at all -- when a manifest range ran past an input's last page,
  while reporting success. Both now report `skipped_pages` (per input file)
  and `missing_files` alongside `pages_written`, warn on stderr for dropped
  pages, and exit 2 instead of writing a valid zero-page PDF when no
  requested page exists
  ([#2379](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/2379),
  [#1902](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1902)). An
  unusable merge manifest is reported as an error result instead of raising
  ([#1921](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1921)), and
  `form_fill` refuses a data file whose top level is not an object
  ([#1903](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1903)).
- Document skills: docx `replace_text` skipped section headers and footers
  ([#1888](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1888)) and counted
  a `replace_run` as applied even when the run index was out of bounds and
  nothing was written
  ([#1896](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1896)); pptx
  `extract_text` did not recurse into nested group shapes
  ([#1894](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1894)); and the
  bundled git-diff and pptx scripts re-encoded their stdout through the
  console code page, mangling non-ASCII output on Windows -- both now write
  bytes ([#1834](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1834)).
- The Windows shell denylist covers `rm` and `ri`, PowerShell's remaining two
  built-in aliases for `Remove-Item` alongside `del`/`rmdir`/`rd`/`erase`/
  `Remove-Item` itself. Anchored to a command position the same way `rd` and
  `erase` already are, so `docker run --rm`, `git rm --cached` and
  `npm run rm-cache` are untouched. `SafeBinPolicy.from_env` also now extends
  the shared catastrophic denylist on Windows instead of replacing it, so
  `rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, `dd if=`, the fork bomb and `shutdown` are gated there
  too -- all of them reachable on a Windows host through git-bash, MSYS,
  Cygwin or WSL, and `shutdown` is a native Windows binary besides. A
  wrapper's payload (`powershell -c "rm -r C:\x"`) is now matched even when
  quoted, and a script that merely starts with an alias name
  (`rm-cache.cmd`, `rd-report.ps1`) is no longer denied
  ([#2100](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/2100),
  [#1964](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1964)).
- Docs: the `agentos memory` reference now lists every subcommand
  ([#2354](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/2354)), and the
  gmgn skills no longer carry broken relative workflow links
  ([#2361](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/2361)).

## [2026.9.14] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- Environment page / `agentos env list`: `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` is now listed
  under Search, owned by `web_fetch`. The tool reads it straight from the
  environment for its Firecrawl escalation, so nothing in onboarding derived
  it and the key was invisible until an operator set it by hand. The
  `multi-search-engine` skill declares every engine key it reads
  (`BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `SERPAPI_API_KEY`,
  `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`) as optional, so `SERPAPI_API_KEY` appears
  under Skills and each key names the engine it unlocks.
- `multi-search-engine` skill: a `firecrawl` engine backed by Firecrawl's
  `/v2/search`, keyed by the `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` that `web_fetch` already
  uses for its Firecrawl escalation, so an install with that key gets the
  engine without further setup. Metadata only -- no `scrapeOptions`, so a
  call spends search credits, not a page scrape per hit -- and included in
  `--engines auto` when the key is set.
- Skills: a `{python}` placeholder next to `{baseDir}`. `skill_view` expands
  it to the interpreter AgentOS itself runs on (`sys.executable` of the
  gateway), and every bundled `SKILL.md` now invokes its scripts as
  `{python} {baseDir}/scripts/…` instead of a bare `python`. A bare `python`
  is whatever the user's PATH resolves to -- on one machine a Homebrew 3.9
  that happened to carry `httpx`, so `multi-search-engine` imported fine and
  then died on `isinstance(x, int | float)`; on a fresh Windows box nothing at
  all -- while only AgentOS's own interpreter is guaranteed to have the
  skill's dependencies and its minimum version. The expanded body also leads
  with a `[Skill interpreter: …]` line so third-party skills that still say
  `python3 script.py` are steered onto it. `agentos skills init --with-script`
  scaffolds the new form, and a test rejects any bundled skill that regresses
  to a PATH python.
- `multi-search-engine` skill: an `x` engine that runs xAI's server-side
  `x_search` (X/Twitter) from the same CLI, using the OAuth login stored by
  `agentos auth login xai` or `XAI_API_KEY` -- it reads the stored access
  token and never refreshes it, since refresh is the gateway's job. Citations
  land in `results` (`engine: "x"`) and the synthesized answer in a new
  top-level `answers` key. Also a `serpapi` engine (`SERPAPI_API_KEY`) and
  `--engines auto`, now the default: DuckDuckGo plus every key-backed engine
  whose key is set, plus `x` when an xAI credential exists. The payload
  reports the resolved list under `engines`.

### Fixed

- Skills: `requires.env` entries declared with `required: false` no longer hide
  the skill when unset. The flag was parsed and shown on the Environment page
  but eligibility and `skills doctor` gated on every declared name regardless,
  so a skill could not declare an optional key without disappearing from
  installs that lacked it.
- Environment page / `agentos env list`: keys of providers the runtime cannot
  drive (`EXA_API_KEY`, `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`, and the LLM vendors catalogued
  with `runtime_supported=False`) are no longer offered as "needed by" that
  provider. Nothing reads them; a value set anyway is still listed, as
  `custom`. The managed-credential list that keeps such names away from
  untrusted skills is unchanged.
- `multi-search-engine` skill: a DuckDuckGo bot challenge (HTTP 202 with an
  "anomaly" page) used to come back as an empty success with no error; the
  script now retries once and then records a per-engine error, so an empty
  `results` with empty `errors` genuinely means no hits. DuckDuckGo redirect
  links (`/l/?uddg=`) are unquoted to the destination URL, sponsored `y.js`
  links are dropped, filtering happens before `--limit`, and snippets keep
  their word spacing across `<b>` tags (#1917). `SKILL.md` and `engines.md`
  no longer advertise Bing, Baidu, Sogou, 360 -- none were implemented, so the
  agent kept requesting `bing` and getting `unknown engine`; the default
  engine list no longer names Brave unconditionally either.

- Web UI: the Memory page now uses the shared Control hero header, so the
  signal background no longer overlaps the stat cards and the page matches
  Health / Overview / Usage (#1927).

## [2026.9.13] - 2026-09-13

### Changed

- The `c0` router tier on the `bankr`, `opencap` and `surplus` tier profiles
  now defaults to DeepSeek V4.1 Flash (`deepseek-v4.1-flash`) instead of V4
  Flash. All three gateways publish the id with a 1M context and 384K max
  output, so the bare id needs no gateway window override, and it is declared
  in `model_registry` with `supports_image` left off: it is a text tier, and a
  vision-flagged text tier would become a random pick for image turns
  alongside `image_model`. The `openrouter` profile deliberately stays on
  `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`: OpenRouter routes V4 Flash cheaper than
  `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` but prices V4.1 Flash above it, so the router's
  cost-aware override would hand every OpenRouter c0 turn to c1. Existing
  configs are not migrated -- `deepseek-v4-flash` still resolves on every
  gateway -- and the direct `deepseek` profile is unchanged.

### Fixed

- `ApprovalQueue.wait()` could leave an approval pending forever after its full
  default timeout had elapsed. The wait deadline was measured on the monotonic
  clock but the "has the approval's lifespan expired?" check re-read
  `time.time()`; on Windows the wall clock ticks at ~15.6ms, so after a short
  wait it could still report the approval as younger than its lifespan and skip
  the deny. The lifespan is now converted to the monotonic clock once at entry.
  This was the intermittent
  `test_approval_queue_wait_denies_once_the_full_default_timeout_elapses`
  failure in the Windows CI job on `main`.
- `apply_patch` no longer rewrites every line of a CRLF file to LF. The
  reported symptom — `Context mismatch ... got '...\r'` — is not reachable
  through the tool: the update path read with `Path.read_text()`, whose
  universal-newline translation folds `\r\n` to `\n` before `_apply_hunk`
  ever sees it. The quieter defect is at the same site: the translation is
  one-way in memory only, so writing back with `write_text()` re-emitted
  `os.linesep` and a one-line patch to a CRLF file came out as a whole-file
  diff, with the untouched lines converted too (and the mirror-image damage
  on Windows, where an LF file came back as CRLF). Both ends of the round
  trip — the read in `_plan_ops` and the write in `_commit_staged` — now open
  with `newline=""`, so endings survive verbatim; `_apply_hunk` compares
  context with `rstrip("\r\n")` so a `\r` cannot fail a match, and an added
  line takes the file's own ending — majority convention, first-seen breaking
  a tie — instead of a hardcoded `\n`. An `*** Add File` goes through the
  same `newline=""` write, so the patch text stays the only authority on what
  a created file contains
  ([#1124](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1124)).
- Twenty per-session registries are bounded behind one shared primitive
  instead of growing for the life of the gateway process. Each was a bare
  `dict` keyed by a session id (or a tuple containing one) with no `pop()` on
  session end and no ceiling, so a gateway serving many short sessions retained
  one entry per session per registry — task-runtime locks, stream replay
  buffers and sequence counters, background shell sessions, stale-output and
  intent-approval caches, archived subagent handles, memory and bootstrap
  snapshots, approval elevations, usage scopes and metadata, plan-mode flags,
  the denial ledger, repeat-call watchdog state, and cache-break baselines.
  Fifteen separate reports had produced twenty competing patches, each with its
  own eviction policy; `agentos.util.BoundedRegistry` replaces them with one
  rule in two configurations — session-scoped state dropped on the session's
  terminal event with an LRU ceiling as the backstop, and time-scoped caches
  with TTL plus a ceiling. `evict_session_runtime_state()`, the choke point
  every deletion and terminal path already runs, now sweeps every registry that
  can identify a session, so the bound really is the backstop rather than the
  mechanism. A value the site declares busy — a held `asyncio.Lock` — is never
  evicted. Both ceilings and the cache TTL are config keys
  (`registry_session_max_entries`, `registry_cache_max_entries`,
  `registry_cache_ttl_seconds`)
  ([#1131](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1131)).
- The four unconditional shell blocks now land in the sandbox denial ledger.
  `_record_shell_denial`'s docstring promised a §8.3/§8.5 record for every
  shell-layer denial, but its only caller was the interactive approval path on
  `approval_denied`; a denylisted binary from `check_safe_bin`, the
  sensitive-path block, the workspace lockdown and the workspace write-deny
  all raised or returned their envelope without touching the ledger, so the
  most severe refusals were exactly the ones missing from the audit trail and
  no §8.3 stale-output purge ran for them. All four now record through a new
  `DenialLedger.record_audit_denial` in both `exec_command` and
  `background_process`. It keeps the per-fingerprint count and the purge and
  deliberately leaves the §8.5 pause counter and the §8.4 `last_fingerprint`
  alone: the pause is permanent, threshold 3, gates every `@sandboxed` tool,
  and the sensitive-path check is a text scan, so routing hard blocks into it
  would have let `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa` three times lock `echo hello` for the
  life of the session. `_sandbox_request_for` moves inside the `try` so a
  removed process cwd cannot replace a clean block envelope with a raise
  ([#1513](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1513)).
- Inline compaction no longer overwrites a follow-up that arrived while the
  turn was running. `persist_compaction_result` derived the rows to replace
  from counts on the *live* transcript, so a `sessions.send` appended between
  the agent loading its history and the `CompactionEvent` being persisted
  fell into the overwritten tail and vanished from both the live and the
  canonical transcript. `TurnRunner._load_history` now records a
  `TranscriptSnapshot` (session id plus the `message_id` of the last row the
  history was built from), the persist adapter hands it through, and the
  manager rewrites and archives only rows inside that snapshot — later rows
  are re-appended verbatim with the same `message_id`, and the summary's
  `covered_through_id` never reaches them. A snapshot whose session or anchor
  row is gone (same-key reset, truncate, manual compaction) is rejected and
  reported as a failed persist rather than written over the newer transcript
  ([#1645](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1645)).
- Structured cron schedules honour the `timezone` alias.
  `coerce_schedule_from_params` read only `schedule.tz`, so a schedule
  carrying `schedule.timezone` — the spelling the expression-shorthand path
  already accepts — was silently scheduled in UTC: a job asked for at 09:00
  Shanghai ran at 09:00 UTC. A new `_schedule_tz` helper accepts either
  spelling, rejects a conflict between the two and a non-string value
  (including the falsy ones `raw.get("tz") or ""` used to swallow), and the
  top-level conflict check goes through it too, so a `schedule.timezone` that
  disagrees with a top-level `tz` raises instead of being overwritten.
  `cron.update`'s explicit-clear detection learns the alias as well
  ([#1603](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1603)).
- `sessions.create` normalizes `displayName` the way `rename` and `patch`
  already do. It was the one gateway write path that skipped
  `normalize_session_name`, and `SessionNode.display_name` carries no
  validation of its own, so raw ANSI/OSC bytes reached whatever terminal later
  rendered the session list, and a pasted multi-line or over-long `/new`
  title broke the single-line, ≤120-character shape list rows assume. Control
  characters are dropped, whitespace collapsed, the name trimmed to
  `MAX_SESSION_NAME_LENGTH`, blank stored as `None`, a non-string rejected;
  the standalone TUI's `/new <title>` normalizes and escapes the title itself
  since it never reaches the gateway
  ([#1618](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1618)).
- The `cron-watchers` skill no longer consumes items it never reported.
  `_watermark.select_new` recorded every fresh id as seen while the three
  watchers printed only `fresh[:limit]`, so anything past `--limit` was lost
  for good — `watch_github.py` fetches 30 per page against a default limit of
  10, so one busy poll could drop 20 items. `select_new` now takes the limit
  and commits only the ids it returns; the surplus surfaces on following
  runs, drained oldest-first so what is deferred is the newest and stays on
  the page longest. `--limit` must be at least 1, and the silent first run
  still adopts the whole feed
  ([#1674](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1674)).
- The `pdf-toolkit` `--tables-strategy` applies to both axes. `extract.py`
  set only `vertical_strategy`, so `text` still looked for ruling lines on
  one axis and found nothing on the borderless tables it is documented for,
  while `explicit` — which needs line coordinates the script cannot supply —
  crashed inside pdfplumber on every call. `explicit` is removed from the
  choices and from `SKILL.md`; `extract()` rejects it with a clear
  `ValueError` ([#1673](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1673)).
- The `docx` skill's `replace_text` reaches placeholders inside tables.
  `apply_ops` iterated `doc.paragraphs`, which python-docx limits to the body,
  so a field inside a table — where contract, report and invoice fields
  usually live — was never replaced and the op reported zero applications; a
  non-dict op crashed with `AttributeError`. It now walks body paragraphs
  plus every table cell, recursing into nested tables and visiting a merged
  cell once, and skips non-dict ops the way `edit_xlsx` already does
  ([#1653](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1653)).
- `ProviderSelector.override_model(model, fallbacks=...)` rebases the held
  position onto the rebuilt chain. It rebuilt `_chain` but left `_index` and
  the breaker admission at positions computed against the old chain, so a
  selector that `resolve()` had already moved onto a fallback either crashed
  with `IndexError` on the next `resolve()` when the new chain was shorter, or
  silently kept serving whatever now sat at the stale index without asking
  the breaker. Auto-Pilot issues exactly this override on the live request
  path, so a tier switch during a provider outage could take down the turn.
  The position now follows its *provider* into the new chain — the admission
  may be this turn's half-open probe, which a second `resolve()` must not
  treat as already in flight — and resets to the primary when the provider
  is gone, as `sync_primary` already does
  ([#1616](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1616)).
- `apply_patch` to `USER.md`, `memory.md` or a nested `memory_source_dir`
  refreshes the memory snapshot. `patch._memory_source_rel_path` kept its own
  copy of the "which files feed the snapshot" rule and knew only `MEMORY.md`
  under the single patch root, so the edit stayed invisible to the model for
  the rest of the session while the same edit through `write_file` or
  `edit_file` fired `on_memory_source_write`. The patch tool now delegates to
  `filesystem._memory_source_rel_path`, which takes the patch root as an extra
  root — one classifier, no drift
  ([#1625](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1625)).
- Slack Approve/Deny clicks resolve on entries not literally named `slack`.
  `_handle_slack_interactive` compared the session key's channel segment
  against `SlackChannel.channel_id`, a dataclass default the registry never
  overwrote, while session keys embed the *entry name* — so on any other
  entry name every click logged `slack.interactive_mismatch` and the approval
  never resolved. `SlackChannel` gains a `name` field, the registry's flat
  path passes `entry.name` to any adapter that accepts one, and the check
  compares against it the way Discord, Telegram and Teams compare against
  `self.config.name`. `channel_id` is left alone: it keys
  `pending_overflow_policy_per_channel`
  ([#1606](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1606)).
- The same defect on Discord: `_handle_discord_component_interaction`
  compared against the literal `discord`, because `DiscordChannelConfig`
  never declared a `name` field for the registry to populate. Every
  multi-account Discord setup has at least one entry not named `discord`, and
  on those every approve/deny click was rejected as a mismatch
  ([#1600](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1600)).
- The provider circuit breaker releases its half-open probe slot on a
  request-shaped failure. `record_failure` ignores non-tripping kinds
  (`MODEL_NOT_FOUND`, `BAD_REQUEST`, `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE`, …) because they
  describe the request, not the provider — but when the ignored failure *was*
  the probe, the early return left `probe_started_at` set and `allow()`
  blocked every other caller for a full cooldown window (up to 600s by
  default), parking a provider nothing had shown to be unhealthy. Such a
  failure now clears the probe and leaves state, counters and backoff
  untouched, so the next caller becomes the probe
  ([#1602](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1602)).
- `apply_patch` treats a bare empty hunk line as blank context. Both loops in
  `_apply_hunk` skipped an empty line outright, but a blank context line is
  written as `""` at least as often as `" "` — editors, terminals, CI and most
  model output strip the trailing space — so verification fell out of step
  with the file and produced a spurious `Context mismatch` pointing at the
  wrong line. A blank that merely separates a hunk from the next marker is
  still ignored ([#1577](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1577)).
- `TerminalChannel.receive()` works on Windows. `_get_reader` handed
  `sys.stdin` to `loop.connect_read_pipe`, which the Proactor loop registers
  with IOCP and fails with `WinError 6 The handle is invalid` from the first
  `readline()`, after the dead transport was already cached. Windows now reads
  a line in the default executor under the existing reader lock; POSIX keeps
  the `StreamReader` path; both share one `errors="replace"` decode and strip
  a trailing CRLF as one terminator
  ([#1575](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1575)).
- Nullable unions spelled `{"type": ["null"]}`, `{"type": null}`,
  `{"const": null}` or `{"enum": [null]}` collapse like `{"type": "null"}`.
  `_is_null_schema` recognised only the last, so the others survived as an
  uncollapsed `anyOf` — the exact construct the module exists to remove
  before a schema reaches a provider that rejects it — and the type-array
  case was rewritten to two identical `string` branches. Type wins over
  const/enum, a branch that admits any real value is never null, and null
  literals are dropped from a type array alongside `"null"`
  ([#1573](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1573)).
- `grep_search`'s `include` glob matches path-qualified patterns. The filter
  ran `fnmatch` against `fp.name` only, so `tests/*.py` could never match and
  the tool answered "No matches" — indistinguishable, to the agent, from
  "this code does not exist". It now matches the filename first and then the
  path relative to the search base, so bare patterns with a literal prefix
  keep working, and a `**/` segment also matches zero directories
  ([#1571](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1571)).
- The email channel refuses to send into an unknown thread instead of mailing
  the Message-ID. `_resolve_target` fell back to treating `reply_to` as a
  mailbox whenever the thread was not in the in-memory routing cache — but
  `reply_to` is an RFC 5322 Message-ID with a mailbox's `local@domain` shape
  and a domain chosen by whoever sent the original mail, so after a restart or
  LRU eviction the reply went to that address. An unknown thread with no
  `metadata["to"]` now raises and logs `email.send_unknown_thread`. Scheduler
  and heartbeat delivery, which relied on the fallback for operator-configured
  addresses, pass `metadata["to"]` — but only when `channel_id` is a
  configured recipient rather than a thread key
  ([#1570](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1570)).
- `gate_action` resolves a relative `cwd` against the workspace.
  `_resolve_workspace` accepted `cwd` only when absolute and otherwise fell
  through to the workspace root, while `action_fingerprint` hashes `cwd`, so
  every relative `workdir` collapsed onto one fingerprint. For `@sandboxed`
  tools with a fixed `argv_factory` such as `git_status`, `cwd` is the only
  discriminator, which made `post_denial_guard` auto-deny a call in `repoB`
  as `REPEATED_SAME_INTENT` after the human had denied `repoA`. A relative
  `cwd` is now joined lexically onto the workspace root, mirroring
  `shell._effective_workdir`
  ([#1595](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1595)).
- `sensitive_target_in_command` resolves relative destructive targets against
  the command's `cwd`, not the workspace root. Whenever `workspace` was
  passed, `cwd` was discarded, so `rm -rf config` with `workdir=~/.aws`
  resolved to `<workspace>/config`, matched no sensitive basename, and the
  hard block "ordinary approval cannot override" never fired; `rm -rf
  .aws/config` from `$HOME` and `rm -rf ../.ssh` slipped past the whole-text
  scan the same way. The two notions are now kept apart: `cwd` anchors a
  relative target, `workspace` measures "inside the workspace", and with no
  workspace configured the `/root` container exception keeps working
  ([#1579](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1579)).
- `read_spreadsheet` no longer crashes on a CSV/TSV cell over Python's
  process-wide 131,072-character field limit — one embedded JSON blob, log
  line or base64 column raised an unhandled `_csv.Error`. The limit is raised
  to `len(text)` for the duration of the parse (never `sys.maxsize`, so a
  malformed quote cannot swallow an arbitrarily large file as one field),
  restored in a `finally`, and guarded by a lock because the limit is
  process-global and the read runs on the shared executor; any remaining
  `csv.Error` becomes a `ToolError`
  ([#1580](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1580)).
- `cron.remove` on an unknown job id is `NOT_FOUND`. `scheduler.remove_job`
  already returned `False`, but the RPC handler discarded it and the CLI then
  invented `{"removed": true}`; it now raises `KeyError` like `cron.status`
  and `cron.update` ([#1598](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1598)).
- Concurrent skill installs no longer clobber each other's lockfile entries.
  `install()` and `uninstall()` each did their own `load` → mutate → `save`
  with no locking, so whichever save landed last won, built from a load taken
  before the other writer's save — 20 concurrent installs dropped 19 entries.
  `Lockfile.update(path, mutate)` holds an exclusive OS-level lock (fcntl /
  msvcrt, on a sibling `*.lock` file so acquiring it never depends on the
  lockfile being valid JSON) across the whole cycle, and `save()` writes
  atomically through a temp file and `os.replace`
  ([#1557](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1557)).
- Status reactions settle on the failure path. Only `completed()` popped
  `_active` and removed the progress emoji; on the `TaskQueueFullError` path
  dispatch calls `received` then `failed` and returns, so a rejected message
  kept both ✅ and ❌ forever and leaked one `_active` entry per rejection.
  `failed()` is now terminal: it clears the progress marks, keeps ❌ as the
  outcome, and tracks nothing that a later call would have to reclaim
  ([#1560](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1560)).
- `run_job_now` executes the row the reservation read, not the snapshot
  taken before it. An `update()` landing between the two reads meant the
  operator who had just saved a change and clicked "run now" got the old
  payload, prompt or timeout — and since `handler_key` derives from the
  payload kind, an edit from an agent turn to a reminder dispatched to the
  old handler. The handler is resolved from the reserved row too, and a
  missing handler finalizes the reservation the way `timer._run_single` does
  ([#1555](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1555)).
- Background shell output decodes multibyte UTF-8 across chunk boundaries.
  `_read_bg_output` decoded each 4096-byte chunk with `errors="replace"`, so a
  CJK character or emoji straddling a boundary came out as `U+FFFD`. It now
  feeds an incremental decoder and flushes at EOF
  ([#1535](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1535)).
- `ApprovalQueue.wait(approval_id, timeout=X)` no longer denies an approval
  when the caller's own bounded wait elapses. The per-call timeout was
  treated as the approval's expiry, so a Web UI poll with `timeout=10` on an
  approval whose real lifespan was the 300s default permanently wrote
  `resolved = 1, approved = 0` after ten seconds, and the operator's later
  Approve raised `Approval already resolved`. The approval is denied only once
  `created_at + default_timeout` has genuinely elapsed; otherwise `wait()`
  returns `False` and leaves it pending
  ([#1568](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1568)).
- `execute_code` shows the whole script in its approval prompt. It passed
  `command=code[:200]` into `_check_exec_approval`, and that string is what
  the human reviewing the approval sees, so a script whose first 200
  characters were imports or a docstring presented as harmless while the
  destructive statement that triggered the prompt was never shown. The
  sensitive-access scan already ran over the full code; only the payload was
  truncated ([#1567](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1567)).
- The git tool resolves a relative `workdir` against the workspace. It was
  returned unresolved, so `_run_git` resolved it against the process CWD and
  inspected `$PWD/<workdir>` whenever the gateway ran anywhere but the
  workspace. It now mirrors `shell._effective_workdir`: a relative path joins
  onto `ctx.workspace_dir` and resolves lexically; absolute paths pass through
  ([#1566](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1566)).
- `read_spreadsheet` finds a sheet literally named `"1"`. The positional
  reading of `sheet` was tested before the exact-name match, so on a workbook
  whose sheets were `["Summary", "1"]`, `sheet="1"` silently returned
  `Summary` and every numeric sheet name — years, step numbers, product codes
  — was unreachable. The exact-name match now wins; positional selection is
  only outranked, never removed
  ([#1569](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1569)).
- `MemorySyncManager.sync()` no longer discards session-delta recorded while
  it was running. It snapshotted `has_pending()` at the top, awaited file and
  session indexing, and then unconditionally `reset()` the tracker — so a
  burst of `notify_message()` calls that arrived mid-sync, never covered by
  that sync's own work, was wiped by its completion and had to accumulate a
  fresh threshold from zero. `SessionDeltaTracker` gains `snapshot()` and
  `consume(snapshot)`, which subtracts the snapshotted amount instead of
  zeroing, and the `session-delta` threshold guard is kept
  ([#1521](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1521)).
- The Windows shell denylist covers every delete spelling. `del` and `rmdir`
  were listed but `rd`, `erase` and `Remove-Item` were not, and the entries
  that duplicated them in `DEFAULT_WARNLIST_WIN` were dead code because the
  denylist is checked first. `rd` and `erase` are anchored to a command
  position — start, `;`, `&`, `|` or newline, optionally behind a `cmd /c` or
  `powershell` wrapper — so a word like `record` does not trip them,
  `Remove-Item` joins the list, the force-push pattern tolerates flags between
  `push` and `--force`, and the dead warnlist entries are removed
  ([#1464](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1464)).

## [2026.9.11] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- The chat composer's route picker now shows the tiers an image turn is routed
  to. They sit below the pinnable list as plain text, not as options: the router
  picks the vision route before holds are consulted, so pinning one would
  install a hold that never takes effect. Until now they were filtered out
  everywhere — `router.hold.get` reports pinnable text tiers only — so the only
  way to learn which model an image would be handed to was to send one and read
  the route label afterwards. `router.hold.get` gained a separate `imageTiers`
  list for this, built by the new `build_router_image_routes()`; it reports
  every `supports_image` tier rather than only the `image_only` one, because the
  router's image branch picks at random among all of them.
  ([#1632](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1632))

### Fixed

- Telegram and Discord `send()` now split a final reply that exceeds the
  platform's message cap instead of losing it. `TelegramChannel.send()` posted
  the full payload with no length check and `DiscordChannel.send()` assigned
  `payload["content"]` directly, so a reply over 4096 rendered characters on
  Telegram or 2000 on Discord failed the API call or was rejected server-side —
  and the final answer is the one output the user is waiting for. Reachable
  whenever streaming is off (a `final_only` stream policy). Telegram already
  owned the splitter (`_split_for_limit`, used by `send_streaming`); `send()`
  just never called it. The cut-point algorithm now lives in the shared
  `agentos.channels._util.split_text_for_limit`, so Discord reuses it rather
  than growing a second splitter that drifts. The splitter also refuses to cut
  inside a fenced code block — an odd number of fences before the cut means one
  is open, and the cut backs up so each half's fences balance, since Telegram
  rejects a message whose entities do not parse. Reply context is scoped per
  chunk: the reply reference goes on the first message, embeds, components and
  keyboards on the last; Discord's interaction-response path sends its first
  chunk via the interaction PATCH and the overflow as channel follow-ups
  instead of dropping it.
  ([#1544](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1544))

- The Telegram formatter now renders a multiline blockquote as one
  `<blockquote>` instead of one bubble per line, and no longer leaks a raw
  `&gt;` on a bare `>` separator line. Lines were parsed one at a time with a
  strict `"> "` prefix check and each wrapped in its own tag, so a quote came
  through as a stack of disjoint bubbles; CommonMark's bare `>` — the way a
  paragraph break is written inside one quote — did not match the prefix at
  all and fell through to inline rendering. The marker is now `_BLOCKQUOTE_RE`
  (up to three leading spaces, `>`, at most one optional space), so `>quote`
  and indented markers are recognised too, and consecutive matching lines —
  empty ones included — are gathered into a single tag. Four or more leading
  spaces still fall through to plain rendering, as before.
  ([#1532](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1532))

- The Slack adapter no longer posts an anchorless outgoing message into
  whichever conversation last spoke. `_last_thread_ts` was one field on the
  `SlackChannel` instance serving every channel, thread and user on the
  account: `parse_event` overwrote it on every inbound event carrying a
  `thread_ts`, and `send` fell back to it whenever the outgoing message had no
  anchor of its own, so a scheduled delivery, a heartbeat or a proactive
  notification could land in an unrelated conversation's thread. The fallback
  is gone rather than scoped — a reply that needs a thread already carries one
  via `build_reply_message` / `streaming_reply_kwargs`, which derive it from
  the specific inbound message — and with no remaining reader the field and
  the `parse_event` write are removed with it. One visible change: with
  `reply_in_thread=True`, an anchorless send that previously happened to land
  in the last-seen thread now posts to the channel un-threaded.
  ([#1543](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1543))

- The Telegram adapter drops `_known_sender_profiles`, a per-sender map that
  was written on every inbound update and every unpaired-DM pairing request
  and read nowhere — unbounded memory growth driven by any user who messages
  a public bot. The field, `_remember_sender()` and the write inside
  `record_access_denial()` are deleted outright rather than capped, since
  bounding it would only keep less dead state alive; the profile dict still
  flows into `pairing_store.request()`, its one real consumer, and queueing,
  dedupe and pairing are unchanged.
  ([#1542](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1542))

- A same-key session reset now aborts when the safety archive cannot be
  written, instead of deleting the only copy of the transcript.
  `_rotate_session_id` called `_archive_session_identity`, discarded its
  return value and unconditionally deleted the transcript and summaries; the
  archiver catches every exception and returns `False` on any I/O failure — a
  full disk, a permissions error, a bad archive path — so a transient write
  failure produced no exception, no log and no archive, immediately followed
  by an irreversible delete. `False` had meant both "nothing to archive" and
  "the write failed". The destructive path now passes `require_success=True`,
  under which a write failure raises and the reset stops with a clear error;
  an empty session still returns `False` and rotates normally, and the
  non-destructive `rotate_session_id_archive_only` stays best-effort. Both
  outcomes are logged.
  ([#1539](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1539))

- Session reset and delete now wait on every active runtime task before
  touching storage. `_drain_task_runtime_for_session`'s final drain loop
  wrapped the whole `for` in one outer `try/except TimeoutError`, so the first
  active task that exceeded `_RESET_RUNTIME_CANCEL_DRAIN_SECONDS` aborted the
  loop and every remaining task was never waited on — the reset then proceeded
  while those tasks could still be running against the session. The earlier
  settle loop in the same function already nested its timeout inside the
  `for`; the drain loop now matches, so each task gets its own window, and the
  warning logged when tasks fail to drain carries `undrained_count` instead of
  implying exactly one was left.
  ([#1538](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1538))

- Scheduler `ops.update`, `ops.pause` and `ops.resume` no longer revert a job
  reservation taken between their `get` and `save`. `_execute_save`'s upsert
  wrote `reservation_token`, `reserved_at`, `reserved_by`,
  `reservation_source` and `scheduled_run_at` unconditionally, so an ops
  caller whose snapshot predated a lock-free `reserve_due_job` claim wrote
  the pre-reservation values back over it: `apply_reserved_result` then
  failed to recognise the token and dropped the finished run's result, and
  the row looked free, so the next tick reserved and ran the same job again
  beside the run still in flight. `save()` / `save_no_commit()` take
  `write_reservation` (default `True`, so the reservation protocol's own
  writes — `clear_reservation` from `timer.py`, `release_reservation`,
  `apply_result` — are unchanged), and the four ops save sites pass `False`.
  `scheduled_run_at` is in the excluded set because that is exactly what
  `clear_reservation` resets.
  ([#1537](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1537))

- `SchedulerTimer` and `HeartbeatLoop` no longer drop a nudge that arrives
  while a tick is running. Both loops called `self._nudge_event.clear()`
  unconditionally *before* waiting on the event, so a `nudge()` set during
  `_tick()` was erased the moment the loop came round to wait for it. In the
  heartbeat loop, where `interval_ms` defaults to 30 minutes and
  `request_now()` is the cron wake hook exposed over RPC, a requested
  heartbeat stalled silently until the full interval expired; in the timer, a
  job inserted or updated during a tick did not wake it. The clear now runs
  after the wake (completion or timeout), and `SchedulerTimer.stop()` sets the
  event the way `HeartbeatLoop.stop()` already did so cancellation is prompt.
  ([#1526](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1526))

- The scheduler's permanent-error classifier no longer reads a status code out
  of a longer number. `_PERMANENT_ERROR_PATTERNS` matched bare codes by plain
  substring, so `"403"` matched the `4033` in `Request timed out after 4033ms`;
  the permanent loop runs before the transient one, so it won over the
  explicit "timed out" signature, and `_apply_result_state` set the job to
  `DISABLED` with no retry — a single network blip whose message carried a
  three-digit millisecond duration permanently disabled a healthy recurring
  job. Bare codes are now matched as whole numbers with a digit-based guard
  (`(?<![\d.])(?:401|403)(?!\d)(?!\.[A-Za-z])`) rather than `\b`, since `.`
  is not a word character and `12.403 seconds` would otherwise still read as
  a 403; `report-403.sh` no longer disables its own job, `got 403.` and
  `http_403` still classify as permanent.
  ([#1519](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1519))

- Memory redaction now masks a secret whose key carries a snake_case
  qualifier. `_KEYWORD_PATTERN` anchored its keyword on `\b`, but `_` is a
  word character, so `reset_token: 8f3a…`, `csrf_token`, `device_token`,
  `push_token` and `verification_token` all passed through unmasked on the
  path `memory_save` and the session indexer run before writing durable
  memory. The keyword may now be preceded by up to four `qualifier_` /
  `qualifier-` segments; it must still sit immediately before the `:`/`=`
  separator, so `token_count` and `my_token_count` do not match and camelCase
  humps are still not split (`sellToken` stays an asset name). The chain is
  bounded rather than `*` on purpose: every `-` is a word boundary, so an
  unbounded chain measured 22 s on one 100 KB line of `8f3a-` repeats, 13 ms
  bounded, on a path that runs per transcript message inside
  `SessionSourceIndexer.sync`.
  ([#1517](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1517))

- Text-encoded tool calls the provider layer already hides from the user are
  now executed rather than silently dropped. `_synthesize_text_tool_events`
  gated extraction on `contains_minimax_protocol()`, which recognises only the
  literal `<minimax:tool_call>` wrapper, while `engine.tool_text_compat` —
  which scrubs the same markup from the reply — already recognised the
  `<tvoe_calls>` typo-wrapper, DSML's pipe-prefixed tags and a bare `<invoke>`
  with no wrapper. For those, the leak suppressor hid the protocol so nothing
  looked wrong, and the `write_file` / `create_xlsx` simply never ran.
  `minimax_compat.py` becomes `text_tool_protocol.py` and keys on a
  well-formed `<invoke name="…">` … `</invoke>` pair, accepting DSML's pipe
  prefix in ASCII or fullwidth form and honouring its `string="false"`
  parameter marker by JSON-decoding the body, so `create_xlsx` receives rows
  rather than an escaped string. Synthesis still happens only when no
  structured tool call arrived, and names the turn did not offer are still
  dropped. The plain-JSON fallback now keys on whether anything was
  synthesized rather than whether any XML parsed, so a quoted `<invoke>` for
  an unoffered tool no longer suppresses a genuine trailing JSON call.
  ([#1514](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1514))

- Shell denial recording now fingerprints the same request the executor ran.
  `_sandbox_request_for` — which builds the `SandboxRequest` handed to
  `_record_shell_denial` for the §8.3 ledger and §8.5 cache purge — passed no
  `env`, so `request.env` was `{}` and `action_fingerprint`'s `PATH`-keyed
  hash never matched the fingerprint produced through `gate_action` at
  execution; it also only honoured an absolute `workdir`, so a relative one
  (`tests`, `./build`) fell back to the workspace root while `exec_command`
  ran in the resolved subfolder. It now resolves `workdir` through
  `_effective_workdir`, populates `env` through `build_subprocess_env`, and
  `exec_command` / `background_process` pass the resolved `Path(cwd)` to
  `gate_action`.
  ([#1562](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1562))

- `> /dev/null` no longer trips workspace lockdown. `_sensitive_shell_block`
  strips null redirections before scanning, but `_shell_write_targets` — the
  only feed into `_workspace_lockdown_shell_block` — ran the redirection
  pattern against the raw command, and `/dev/null` is under no lockdown root,
  so `pip install requests > /dev/null 2>&1` was refused with
  `reason="workspace_lockdown"` naming `/dev/null` as an out-of-workspace
  write. The scanner now routes through `_without_shell_null_redirections`
  first (covering `>`, `2>`, `&>` and `> /dev/null 2>&1`) and drops
  `_NULL_SINK_PATH` from the result afterwards, which is what catches
  `| tee /dev/null`, where the sink is an argument rather than a redirection.
  A real target beside a null sink — `cmd > /etc/passwd 2>/dev/null` — is
  still reported and still blocked. Windows' `NUL` is deliberately left for
  its own issue.
  ([#1545](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1545))

- The destructive-intent extractor no longer reads `rm` inside a quoted
  argument as a delete. `_extract_rm_targets` matched `\brm\b` anywhere in
  the command, so `grep -rn "rm" /etc/passwd` extracted `delete /etc/passwd`
  and hit the `/etc` hard block — the one documented as surviving user
  approval, so the operator could not approve past a false positive on a
  read-only command — and `git commit -m "rm the old config"` landed spurious
  `<cwd>/the` and `<cwd>/old` intents in the approval cache. Anchoring to a
  command position was measured and rejected because it misses `sudo rm`,
  `env FOO=1 rm`, `time rm` and `xargs rm`. Instead a quoted span is data
  until something runs it: `_command_spans` returns the unquoted text plus any
  quoted span introduced by a shell-invoking command — `sh`/`bash`/`zsh`/
  `dash`/`ash`/`ksh` with a `-c` flag found anywhere in its option prefix
  (`bash -e -c "…"`, `bash -o pipefail -c "…"`), and `ssh` anywhere in the
  prefix (`ssh -p 22 host "…"`) — so `sh -c "rm -rf /etc/passwd"` keeps its
  hard block while `echo "rm -rf /"` and `cat "rm notes.txt"` do not.
  ([#1349](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1349))

- `browser.allowed_domains` now accepts every conventional spelling of an
  entry, and refuses an unusable one at config time. `_domain_allowed`
  compares against `urlparse(url).hostname`, and `configure_browser` only
  lowercased and trimmed the configured entries, so `.example.com`,
  `*.example.com`, `https://example.com`, `example.com/` and `EXAMPLE.COM.`
  could never equal a host and the allowlist matched nothing — failing
  closed, but with a refusal that named the very domain the operator had just
  allowlisted, and no non-empty example in `agentos.toml.example` or
  `docs/configuration.md` to check against. `_normalize_allowed_domain()`
  reduces each entry to the hostname it means through `urlparse`, collapses
  duplicate spellings, and raises naming the accepted format for an entry
  that cannot be a hostname (`://`, `http://`, `?`) rather than dropping it —
  the same shape `normalize_tool_profile` applies to cron tool profiles. A
  blank entry is skipped, not refused. The match itself is unchanged:
  `example.com` still covers `www.example.com` and not `evil-example.com`.
  ([#1478](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1478))

- The chat composer's route picker now names the model a turn actually ran on
  while routing is automatic, and stops claiming an override when nothing is
  pinned. Pasting an image labelled the button `Auto · image_model` — a bare
  tier key with no model beside it, and one that appears nowhere in the picker's
  menu, because `router.hold.get` reports pinnable text tiers only. The
  `router_decision` event already carries the model that ran; `useRoutePin` was
  discarding it. It is kept now and the Auto label reads `Auto · c2 · glm-5.2`
  (the full route is repeated in the button's title, which the width-capped
  label elides). Reading the model off the decision is also the only correct
  source: the image branch picks at random among every `supports_image` tier, so
  the model genuinely varies per turn when more than one is configured.
  The `image route` badge, whose tooltip says image turns are routed before the
  pin is applied, is now shown only when a pin actually exists to be bypassed.
  ([#1631](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1631))

- `read_spreadsheet` no longer mislabels row numbers or dead-ends its own
  pagination on a sparse `.xlsx` sheet. OpenXML omits empty rows from
  `<sheetData>`, storing each present row's real 1-indexed number on its
  `r` attribute; `_read_xlsx_worksheet` now keys rows by that number
  directly (a sparse map) instead of padding a list up to it, so a sheet
  with data at, say, row 1 and row 5000 reports and paginates against the
  real row numbers throughout, and the tool's own continuation offsets
  reach row 5000 instead of stalling in the gap. Keying by real row number
  also means reading no longer costs anything proportional to how large a
  declared (or crafted/corrupt) row index is, nor does it multiply by how
  many sheets a workbook has before one is selected.
  ([#1149](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1149))

## [2026.9.10] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- `agentos --version` prints the installed version and exits. The CLI had no
  way to report its own version: the flag failed with `No such option:
  --version`, there was no `version` command, and the only top-level options
  were `--install-completion`, `--show-completion` and `--help`, so the version
  was reachable only from outside the tool via `uv tool list` or `pip show`.
  The value comes from the existing `importlib.metadata` resolution in
  `agentos/__init__.py`, so there is no second source of truth to drift
  ([#1364](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1364)).

- Multiple enabled Slack webhook accounts now register distinct routes
  instead of silently colliding on one. `ChannelManager.collect_webhook_routes()`
  called `create_webhook_route()` without arguments, and every adapter
  defaulted to `/slack/events`; with more than one webhook account enabled,
  Starlette dispatched only to the first matching route, and the rest failed
  signature verification on events meant for them. Config entries with an
  empty `webhook_path` now auto-derive `/slack/events/<account_name>` — but
  only for accounts after the first, so the first enabled webhook account
  keeps `/slack/events` and adding a second account never silently re-paths
  (and 404s) an already-configured one. Duplicate or colliding paths across
  channel entries are now rejected at gateway startup with a descriptive
  error naming both conflicting entries, instead of one adapter silently
  never receiving events
  ([#1022](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1022)).

### Changed

- `sessions.send` no longer reads a whole transcript to answer a yes/no
  question. `_persist_user_message` decided one boolean with
  `not bool(await get_transcript(key))`, and an unbounded `get_transcript`
  turns `limit=None` into `LIMIT -1` and builds a `TranscriptEntry` per row —
  so the entire history was read and deserialised on every user message, with
  the cost growing alongside the conversation still in progress. Measured on a
  5,000-entry session: 135.12 ms unbounded against 4.39 ms for a single row.
  The bound is passed through the shared signature probe, since several
  session managers accept the key alone
  ([#1368](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1368)).

- The memory session indexer skips transcripts the index already has.
  `SessionSourceIndexer.sync` read every session's full transcript, ran the
  redaction pass over every entry and rendered the whole document — for every
  session up to `max_sessions` (default 1000) — before `index_file` hashed the
  result and returned 0 for anything unchanged. Measured at 377 ms discarded
  per sync over 50 sessions x 200 messages, projecting to roughly 7.5 s at the
  default cap, paid on session start, on the timer, on watch events and ahead
  of memory searches. One batched `store.get_file_mtimes` query now decides
  which sessions need reading; `append_message` touches `updated_at` on every
  append, so a session that gained a message always compares newer and is
  never skipped
  ([#1432](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1432)).

### Fixed

- `sessions.truncate` validates `maxMessages` before anything destructive
  runs. `_handle_sessions_truncate` read the value with no validation at all,
  and `bool` is a subclass of `int`: `maxMessages: false` became 0 and wiped
  the entire transcript while answering `ok: true`, `true` kept only the newest
  message, and a string reached the manager's own `< 0` check and raised
  `TypeError` that the dispatcher turned into a raw `INTERNAL_ERROR` carrying
  the Python error string. The new guard raises `ValueError`, which the RPC
  registry already maps to `INVALID_REQUEST`. `maxMessages: 0` stays valid —
  it is the intentional wipe, already gated by the checkpoint/force check
  ([#1371](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1371)).

- `projects.update` rejects a boolean `expectedUpdatedAt` instead of comparing
  it, the same class of unvalidated-`bool`-as-`int` defect
  ([#1261](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1261)).

- `write_file` records workspace writes when it overwrites an existing file,
  so the artifact-delivery path sees the new content rather than treating the
  turn as having produced nothing
  ([#1205](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1205)).

- The docx skill's `replace_text` keeps a paragraph's runs.
  `_replace_text_in_paragraph` joined every run, replaced on the whole string,
  wrote the result into `runs[0]` and emptied the rest — and a run is where
  Word stores character formatting, so bold, italic, underline, font, size and
  colour were discarded for the entire paragraph even when one word changed.
  Nothing errored and the text read correctly, so the document looked right and
  was wrong when opened, against a skill promising "in-place edit-by-run
  (preserves styles)". Every character now stays with the run it came from, and
  a replacement is written into the run owning the first character of its
  match; a `find` spanning runs leaves the surrounding runs' text and
  formatting intact
  ([#1447](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1447)).

- The xlsx skill's `set_cell` honours an explicit `null`. `edit_xlsx` wrote
  through `ws.cell(..., value=...)`, and openpyxl's helper ends with `if value
  is not None`, so `{"value": null}` only read the cell: the previous value
  survived while the script counted the edit and exited 0 reporting
  `{"applied": 1}`. Assignment now goes through the property. A sentinel
  separates a missing `value` key from an explicit null, so a typo cannot
  become silent data loss; `0`, `false` and `""` are unaffected
  ([#1260](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1260)).

- The xlsx skill's `as_text` produces a text cell rather than a quoted value.
  `_coerce` implemented the flag as `return "'" + value`, but Excel's leading
  apostrophe is an input-mode escape, not cell content — the cell held
  `'=hello` where the caller asked for `=hello`, `len()` was off by one, and
  `inspect_xlsx` reported the quoted string back. The flag was also consulted
  only on the `startswith("=")` branch, so the ISO-8601 coercion ran regardless
  and a timestamp could not be stored as text. `as_text` now suppresses the
  datetime coercion, leaves the value untouched and sets `data_type` and
  `quotePrefix`, and it consumes a leading apostrophe when escaping a formula
  so `"=hello"` and `"'=hello"` land on the same cell
  ([#1358](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1358)).

- The xlsx skill accepts inspector-style string merge ranges alongside the
  dictionary merge specs it already took
  ([#1250](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1250)).

- pptx text extraction preserves paragraph boundaries, including inside table
  cells, instead of running them together
  ([#1430](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1430)).

- The MCP stdio client serialises its requests. Concurrent tool calls against
  one stdio server read from the same `asyncio.StreamReader` and raised
  `RuntimeError: readuntil() called while another coroutine is already waiting
  for incoming data`, so any multi-tool turn touching one server could fail;
  `_send_request` and `_send_notification` now hold an `asyncio.Lock`
  ([#1462](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1462)).

- A replaced browser supervisor is stopped outside the registry lock.
  `SupervisorRegistry.get_or_start` tore down the previous supervisor inside
  `self._lock`, and `CDPSupervisor.stop()` is bounded at 5 s on the close call
  plus 5 s on the thread join — paid in full exactly when the connection is
  dead or its URL changed. The registry is process-wide, so one wedged socket
  stalled every other browser path: dialogs, eval, `_drop_session`, the idle
  reaper and gateway teardown. Measured with a 3 s `stop()`, an unrelated
  `get()` blocked 2.70 s; after the change, 0.00 s. `start()`, `stop()` and
  `stop_all()` already followed this rule
  ([#1496](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1496)).

- `browser.max_sessions` is enforced when the cap is lowered. `configure_browser`
  dropped live sessions for a `cdp_port` or `enabled` change but not for
  `max_sessions`, `_evict_if_over_cap` was reached only when a *new* session was
  created, and reusing a session refreshes `last_used_at` so the idle reaper
  never took it — so sessions in active use stayed over the new cap
  indefinitely, against a documented "at most `max_sessions` run at once
  (oldest-idle evicted)". Each managed session is a Chromium process and
  lowering the cap is how an operator relieves memory pressure, so the number
  changed in config and nothing changed on the box. The reconfigure path now
  trims to the cap, evicting oldest-idle and logging
  `browser.session_evicted_on_reconfigure`
  ([#1498](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1498)).

- Bare day-of-week step expressions match croniter for every start value. The
  `N/M` branch of `_parse_field` built its value set as `range(N, hi + 1, M)`
  with `hi = 7`, correct only when `N == 0`: `7/2` gave `{0}` and `6/2` gave
  `{6}` where both should be `{0,2,4,6}`, and `1/3` included a spurious Sunday.
  croniter treats 7 as a pure alias for 0 rather than an eighth slot, rewrites
  a bare `N/M` to `N-6/M`, and expands to the whole field stepped when the
  start resolves to the true max — now replicated exactly, scoped to the
  bare-value day-of-week branch
  ([#1501](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1501)).

- The Microsoft Teams adapter's `edit()` and `delete()` target the right
  conversation. Both resolved a reference with
  `next(iter(self._references.values()))` — whichever conversation was cached
  first — ignoring `message_id` entirely, so with more than one conversation
  cached an edit or delete landed on someone else's thread. `send()` and
  `send_streaming()` in the same file already resolved by key, and now record
  the message-to-conversation mapping the two destructive paths consult, with a
  most-recent fallback for untracked ids
  ([#1494](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1494)).

- Telegram keeps Markdown markers out of a link's href. `_render_inline`
  substituted `[text](url)` into an anchor and only then ran the `**`, `__`,
  `~~` and `*` passes, which match anywhere — so a URL carrying them was
  rewritten inside the attribute and Telegram rejected the whole message with
  "can't find end tag of href", losing the reply rather than degrading it. The
  URL is now parked behind a placeholder for those passes while the link text
  stays exposed. `_plain_inline` had the same hazard with a worse outcome —
  `str.replace` removed the characters outright, so a label linked to
  `foo__bar__baz` pointed at `foobarbaz`
  ([#1435](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1435)).

- Discord slash commands keep falsy option values and reconstruct subcommands.
  `_handle_interaction` filtered options on truthiness, silently dropping `0`
  and `False`, and never descended into subcommand or subcommand-group options,
  so their names were lost: `/temperature value: 0` arrived as `/temperature`
  and `/agentos status` as `/agentos`. Every leaf value is now appended as-is
  and nested options are walked into the command path
  ([#1229](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1229)).

- The email channel bounds IMAP fetch and parse retries. A permanently
  oversized message is quarantined immediately, a transient failure gets a
  bounded number of retries before quarantine, and the per-UID attempt counter
  is pruned to the current poll's UNSEEN set each cycle so it cannot grow
  without bound over the connection's lifetime
  ([#1209](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1209)).

- The Ollama provider fails fast and names the cause. It handed `cfg.timeout`
  (120 s by default) to httpx as a single timeout, so the connect phase got the
  whole request budget, and it surfaced failures verbatim — "Request error: All
  connection attempts failed", or a raw 404 carrying Ollama's own JSON. The
  connect phase is now bounded at 5 s while the read timeout stays at
  `cfg.timeout`, since a first token can legitimately wait for a model to load;
  connect failures name the base URL and `ollama serve`, and a 404 mentioning
  the model says to `ollama pull` it. Both messages keep the words
  `classify_provider_error` keys on, so `TRANSPORT_TRANSIENT` and
  `MODEL_NOT_FOUND` classification is preserved
  ([#1366](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1366)).

- `agentos upgrade` stops the managed gateway first on Windows. The gateway is
  spawned as `sys.executable`, which inside a uv tool venv is the very
  `Scripts\python.exe` that `uv tool install --force` must replace, so the
  upgrade failed with "Access is denied", could leave the tool directory
  half-replaced, and afterwards `agentos` was gone from PATH. On Windows only,
  a running managed gateway is now stopped before the upgrade and started again
  afterwards with the same bounded version verification; if the upgrade fails
  or times out the gateway is restarted on the previous version rather than
  left down, and `--no-restart` still opts out. An "Access is denied" failure
  also names the recovery
  ([#1365](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1365)).

- `web_fetch` clamps a `max_chars` below the documented minimum instead of
  disabling truncation. `_resolve_effective_max_chars()` returned `None` for
  anything under 100 and `_apply_max_chars()` reads `None` as unlimited, so
  `max_chars=1` returned the entire untruncated page — smaller requests
  returning more data than larger ones. Values below 100 are now clamped up to
  it, matching the schema's documented minimum and the env-configured default
  ([#1400](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1400)).

- The `./` prefix is stripped without eating a dot-prefix. `str.lstrip("./")`
  takes a character set, not a prefix, so it removed every leading `.` and `/`
  — including the dot that makes a dotfile. In the write policy it ran over
  both the deny pattern and the candidate, so a rule written as `.env*`
  normalised to `env*` and blocked `environment.md`, `envoy.yaml` and
  `env_setup.py`; in the skill tools it mangled the requested name before
  `read_resource` saw it, so a resource called `.eslintrc.json` was reported
  missing
  ([#1244](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1244)).

- Underscores survive inside IDENTITY.md field values. `_strip_markdown_inline`
  removed emphasis with `_{1,3}(.*?)_{1,3}` and no boundary condition, so any
  two underscores on a line paired up as a delimiter run and an agent named
  `my_agent_name` was told its name is `myagentname`. CommonMark disallows
  intra-word emphasis with `_`, and the pattern now carries that condition; the
  asterisk branch is deliberately unchanged, since `a*b*c` really is emphasis
  ([#1428](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1428)).

- `/file` and `/image` resolve unquoted paths containing spaces.
  `_parse_path_prompt` split unquoted input at the first whitespace, so a path
  pasted from a file manager was truncated at its first space and
  `/file /tmp/data set.csv summarise this` reported `File not found:
  /tmp/data`. The unquoted branch now scans word spans shortest-first for the
  first existing regular file, keeps the remaining words as the prompt, and
  falls back to the first token so a genuinely missing path still reports the
  usual error. Quoted paths are unaffected
  ([#1228](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1228)).

## [2026.9.9] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- Signature probing has one home. `_accepts_keyword_arg` had been copy-pasted
  into four modules that gave three different answers when `inspect.signature`
  raised: `gateway/rpc_sessions.py` returned `True` and passed the keyword
  anyway, `gateway/channel_dispatch.py` and `gateway/context_overflow.py`
  returned `False`, and `engine/runtime.py` had no `try` at all, so the
  exception escaped into its caller. The canonical
  `agentos.compat.inspect_utils.accepts_keyword_arg` returns `False` — the safe
  direction, and what three of the four sites already did, since passing a
  keyword the target does not take raises `TypeError` and fails the turn while
  omitting an optional one leaves the target on its own default. Compaction
  provider resolution is unified the same way
  ([#1201](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1201)).

### Fixed

- Telegram polling retries failed callbacks before acknowledging their updates,
  with at most three handling attempts per update. Exhausted updates are logged
  at error level and skipped so later messages can proceed; repeated callback
  IDs are deduplicated before approval handling.
  ([#1027](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1027))

- Background tasks spawned with `asyncio.create_task()` keep a strong
  reference for their lifetime. The event loop holds only weak references, so
  a task nothing else points at may be collected mid-execution: Slack's
  interactive-approval dispatch in `_handle_socket_frame` and `_handle_webhook`
  fired `self._handle_slack_interactive(payload)` and dropped the handle, and
  several other fire-and-forget sites did the same. Each now stores its task in
  a set and discards it from a done callback, so an approval press cannot
  vanish between the button and the handler
  ([#1033](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1033)).

- A DuckDuckGo outage now reads as an outage instead of a quiet zero-result
  search. `DuckDuckGoProvider.search()` swallowed every `httpx.HTTPError` and
  returned `[]` unless it was built with `diagnostics=True`, so a 403, a 429 or
  a timeout was indistinguishable from "nothing matched" — and nothing set that
  flag: `_search_provider_kwargs()` in `tools/builtin/web.py` singled
  DuckDuckGo out to receive `diagnostics=_active_search_diagnostics`, which is
  `False` on a default gateway, so the constructor default was overridden to
  off at the one call site that mattered. Both layers move: the provider
  defaults to reporting and classifies the failure the way its Brave and Tavily
  siblings already do (401/403 `auth`, 429 `rate_limit`, other statuses `http`,
  plus `timeout` and `network`, each carrying `status_code` and `retryable`),
  and the tool boundary only ever turns diagnostics *on*. `diagnostics=False`
  stays as an explicit opt-out for a caller that depends on `search()` never
  raising; `run_web_search_payload` already routes anything raised into its
  `ok: false` envelope, so the tool contract is unchanged
  ([#1122](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1122)).

- `bankr` and `openai_responses` failures classify like every other
  OpenAI-compatible provider instead of falling through to `UNKNOWN`. Both are
  real registered providers, and both declare `failure_family="openai_compat"`
  in `provider/registry.py`, but neither appeared in the hand-kept
  `_OPENAI_COMPAT_PROVIDERS` literal in `provider/failures.py`, so their 401,
  402 and 429 lost the auth / credit / rate-limit semantics the runtime uses to
  choose `FAIL_CONFIG` or `FALLBACK_PROVIDER`. The literal was the wrong shape
  rather than merely two names short: it had drifted to six missing providers
  (`bankr`, `openai_responses`, `github_copilot`, `openai_codex`,
  `byteplus_coding_plan`, `volcengine_coding_plan`), and #775 reported the
  `bankr` half a while ago without the fix landing. It is now derived from the
  registry's own `failure_family` field, with a test asserting the two files
  agree in both directions
  ([#1126](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1126)).

- A local version label containing `dev` or `post` no longer demotes a final
  release. `parse_version()` in `compat/version_utils.py` already captured
  `+local` into its own regex group, but the fallbacks for a bare `.post` /
  `.dev` segment re-scanned the *whole* raw string with `re.search`, and the
  optional `[._-]?` delimiter let those patterns match anywhere — including
  inside the label. `2026.7.18+dev` parsed as `.dev0` and `2026.7.18+postgres`
  as `.post0`, so a released build sorted as a pre-release and `is_newer()`
  inverted, producing spurious upgrade notices and wrong version-skew answers.
  PEP 440 says a local label must not affect ordering. The regex now names the
  `post` and `dev` literals (`post_l` / `dev_l`), so "was the segment present"
  is answered by the anchored match instead of a re-scan; a bare `.post` /
  `.dev` still means 0, and `+dev`, `+postgres`, `+device` and `+local.post1`
  are ignored for ordering
  ([#1130](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1130)).

- The Discord channel reconnects with bounded exponential backoff instead of
  dying on the first failed attempt. `DiscordChannelConfig` declared
  `reconnect_max_retries` and `reconnect_base_delay_s` and nothing consumed
  them: the reconnects triggered by `ConnectionClosed`, Op 7 (Reconnect) and
  Op 9 (Invalid Session) ran with no exception handling and no delay, so one
  transient outage, bad resume URL or handshake timeout raised out of
  `_dispatch_loop` and silently terminated `_dispatch_task`. `_connected` was
  cleared only in `stop()`, so `is_connected()` kept answering `True` for a
  channel that was completely deaf. Both settings are now wired into
  `_reconnect()`, consecutive failures back off as
  `min(60.0, base_delay * 2 ** (failures - 1))` and reset on success, and a
  done callback on the dispatch task marks the channel dead and cancels the
  heartbeat so `is_connected()` reports the truth
  ([#1133](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1133)).

- Coroutines call `asyncio.get_running_loop()` rather than the deprecated
  `asyncio.get_event_loop()`. Inside a running coroutine the latter is
  deprecated from Python 3.10 on and raises `RuntimeError` in a background
  worker thread that has no OS-thread default loop. The replacement covers the
  filesystem tools (`read_file`, `read_spreadsheet`, `write_file`, `edit_file`,
  `list_dir`, `glob_search`, `grep_search`), the media tools, `apply_patch`,
  the CDP browser supervisor, `load_workspace_files_async`, memory sync polling
  and the coalesced-message drain in `channel_dispatch`
  ([#1136](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1136)).

- The email channel addresses messages by IMAP UID instead of sequence number.
  `search`, `fetch` and `store` operate on sequence numbers, which shift
  whenever any other client expunges the monitored mailbox (RFC 3501
  §2.3.1.2) — so an expunge during a poll could make `_fetch_one` read the
  wrong message and `_mark_seen` flag the wrong one, and flagging an oversized
  message shifted the numbers for the rest of the batch. `_fetch_unseen` now
  issues `uid("SEARCH", "UNSEEN")`, and the fetch and store paths use their
  `uid` equivalents, so an identifier stays bound to the message it named
  ([#1162](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1162)).

- `DiscordChannel.send_file` reopens the upload body on every retry. The file
  handle was opened outside `retry_request` and the same object handed to each
  attempt, but `retry_request` re-invokes its callable on 429, on
  500/502/503/504 and on `ConnectError`/`TimeoutException` — by then the first
  attempt has read the stream to EOF, so httpx sent a 0-byte body, Discord
  stored an empty file, and `raise_for_status()` saw the 200 for that empty
  upload. Nothing raised: silent corruption, on the rate-limit path that is by
  far Discord's most likely retry trigger. The body is now opened inside the
  retried callable, the way `SlackChannel.send_file` already did it
  ([#1164](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1164)).

- A prepend hunk lands at the top of the file. `_parse_hunk_header` already
  anticipates `old_start == 0`, so `@@ -0,0 +1,N @@` is a supported input
  shape, but `_apply_hunk` converted it with `pos = hunk.old_start - 1`, and
  the resulting `-1` made the splice `result[:pos] + new_lines +
  result[pos + hunk.old_count :]` resolve to `result[:-1] + new_lines +
  result[-1:]` — the new lines were inserted *before the last line* of the
  file, and the tool reported `1 file(s) modified` and exited clean either way.
  `pos` is now clamped with `max(hunk.old_start - 1, 0)`, so a zero start means
  the top of the file
  ([#1166](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1166)).

- `apply_patch` applies its operations atomically. `_apply_ops` wrote each
  operation to disk as it iterated, so a patch whose second op failed left the
  first one committed — and because the exception escapes `apply_patch` before
  the bookkeeping at the end of the call, `_record_workspace_file_writes`,
  `_notify_memory_source_writes` and `_notify_bootstrap_source_writes` were all
  skipped, leaving the filesystem mutated while the runtime's view of it was
  not, so artifact delivery and memory indexing silently disagreed with disk.
  A new `_plan_ops` resolves every op and runs every hunk in memory before
  anything is written, so the predictable failures — missing file, existing
  file, context mismatch — are raised against a clean workspace
  ([#1169](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1169)).

- Cancelling in-flight tasks skips the reservation tokens parked alongside
  them. `try_acquire` inserts a bare `object()` into `self._tasks` to make the
  cap check atomic — the `# type: ignore[arg-type]` on that insert was the set
  knowingly violating its own `set[asyncio.Task[Any]]` annotation — and
  `cancel_all` then called `.cancel()` on every member. The token raised
  `AttributeError: 'object' object has no attribute 'cancel'` partway through
  the loop, which aborted both the remaining cancellations and the `gather`,
  leaving real work running through a shutdown; `_dispatch` calls
  `try_acquire(_reservation_token)` with a bare `object()`, so the path is
  live. `cancel_all` now filters to `isinstance(t, asyncio.Task)` before
  cancelling ([#1172](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1172)).

- Printed command hints are quoted for the platform they will be pasted into.
  Every "next step" line AgentOS prints is meant to go straight back into the
  user's shell, and each site built it with `shlex.quote`, which knows only
  POSIX rules — on Windows a config path with a space came back as
  `--config 'C:\Program Files\Agent OS\x.toml'`, which neither `cmd.exe` nor
  PowerShell parses as one argument, and Windows is where paths with spaces are
  most common, so the hint broke exactly where it was needed most. A new
  `src/agentos/cli_quoting.py` holds one `quote_cli_arg` (POSIX `shlex.quote`;
  on Windows, double quotes only when the value actually needs them) and one
  `config_cli_arg` for the ` --config <path>` suffix that five call sites had
  each been assembling by hand
  ([#1180](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1180)).

- `sessions.preview` reads a bounded window of each transcript. The
  120-character snippet of the last message was built by calling
  `get_transcript(session_id, limit=-1)` for every session in the list, so
  previewing 50 long-running sessions read and deserialized 50 complete
  histories to look at their tails. The preview now reads through
  `get_recent_transcript`: 10 entries first, widened once to 50 when the tail
  is all tool traffic and holds no user or assistant message to show, and
  stopped early once the window already covers the whole session. Storage
  without a `get_recent_transcript` keeps the full read rather than losing the
  preview entirely, and the snippet itself is unchanged
  ([#1186](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1186)).

- `_emit_metric` logs the recording failures it used to swallow. It writes the
  metric log line, then records to Prometheus inside a `try` whose
  `except Exception` was a bare `pass`, so a metric that never reached the
  registry looked exactly like one that did — the line above says it was
  emitted either way, and an operator chasing a counter that stopped moving had
  nothing to go on. The failure is now logged at debug with the metric name and
  the exception type and message. Debug rather than warning because this is an
  observability gap, not a turn failure, and it must not add noise to a working
  turn: `record_metric` already swallows and debug-logs its own registry
  errors, so what actually reaches this handler is the deferred import or the
  label build failing — exactly the case where the counter silently stops and
  nothing says why
  ([#1188](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1188)).

- A cancelled channel reply is counted, and labelled apart from a delivery
  error. `_reply_done` read the outcome as
  `exc = t.exception() if not t.cancelled() else None` — the guard is needed,
  since `exception()` raises on a cancelled task, but it also sent a real
  cancellation down the `exc is None` path, which emitted nothing. So
  `turn_cancellations_total` never counted an actual cancelled reply, and
  delivery exceptions were the only thing it did count. Both terminal outcomes
  now record on the same counter with distinct `reason` labels —
  `reply_task_cancelled`, logged at info, and `reply_task_error`, logged at
  error with `exc_info` as before — so an operator can tell an interrupted turn
  from a broken delivery. The metric name is unchanged
  ([#1190](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1190)).

- A gateway with no session backend answers `UNAVAILABLE` rather than
  `NOT_FOUND`. Every session handler guarded `ctx.session_manager` and its
  storage with `raise KeyError("No session manager available")`, and
  `RpcRegistry.dispatch` maps `KeyError` to `NOT_FOUND` — a permanent,
  non-retryable verdict for a condition that is neither permanent nor about the
  key, and indistinguishable from a real lookup miss for any caller whose
  `except KeyError:` was written to catch only the latter. The handlers now
  raise `RpcUnavailableError`, which is already what
  `rpc_chat._require_chat_session_manager`, `rpc_memory` and `rpc_sessions`
  itself raise for exactly this shape
  ([#1192](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1192)).

- RPC parameter validation no longer rests on a bare `assert`. Four handlers
  narrowed `params: dict | None` with `assert isinstance(params, dict)`, and
  `python -O` / `PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1` strip assertions, so on an optimized
  interpreter the narrowing promised to mypy is not the narrowing the runtime
  gets. Scoped honestly: in all four the assert is preceded by
  `_require_key(params)` or `_require_name(params)`, both of which already
  raise `ValueError` on a non-mapping, so the `TypeError` was not reachable
  today — the defect is that the `INVALID_REQUEST` guarantee rested on that
  call ordering plus an interpreter flag rather than on the guard itself.
  Each site now validates explicitly
  ([#1194](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1194)).

- Router code targets match `C++`, `C#` and `.NET` regardless of what sits
  next to them. `_CODE_TARGET_RE` wrapped all three inside one
  `\b(?:...)\b` alternation, and since `+` and `#` are non-word characters and
  `.net` opens with one, that group silently required a word character on the
  *wrong* side: immediately after `c++`/`c#`, so `"Translate this to C++."`
  never matched, and immediately before `.net`, so `"to .NET"` never matched
  when preceded by whitespace — while `C++17` and `ASP.NET` matched by
  accident, satisfying the wrong-side requirement. Inverting the assertion
  would have swapped which half broke. The three names are instead pulled out
  of the shared group and given a `\b` on their word-character edge only —
  `+`, `#` and a leading `.` cannot blend into a surrounding identifier — so
  the sentence-boundary spellings and the attached ones (`C++17`, `C#7`,
  `ASP.NET`) all match
  ([#1198](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1198)).

- `git_commit(files=[])` stages nothing instead of everything. The branch was
  chosen with `if files:`, and `bool([])` is `False`, so an explicitly empty
  list took the same path as an omitted argument and ran `git add -A`: a caller
  asking to commit only what it had already staged got the entire working tree
  instead, including untracked files it never named — an untracked
  `secret.txt` sitting beside the staged change lands in the commit. Two
  different intents had been collapsed into one branch by a truthiness test.
  The check is now `if files is None` for `git add -A` and `elif files` for the
  named paths, so an empty list falls through to the commit with whatever the
  caller had staged
  ([#1203](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1203)).

- `events_wait` no longer hands `recv_event` a timeout above the five-minute
  cap. On coarse clocks (Windows ticks at ~15ms) two `time.monotonic()` reads
  inside one tick reduce the remaining wait to `(t + cap) - t`, which rounds a
  hair above `cap` for many values of `t`; the remaining wait is now re-clamped
  to the capped timeout on every loop iteration.

### Security

- Host credential files are hard-blocked wherever they appear, not only under
  the directories `_SENSITIVE_PREFIXES` already named. The denylist matched on
  directory prefixes, so a credential file outside one of them —
  `~/.dockercfg`, `~/.git-credentials`, `~/.htpasswd`, `~/.pgpass`, `~/_netrc`
  — reached the executor unguarded. Those names are now derived from the
  credential-file list in `redact.py`, the module that already knows which
  files carry secrets, with a guard test asserting the two stay in sync, and
  they are blocked in the destructive-target gate and the read gate alike,
  including with Windows separators. `sensitive_path_in_text` also scans the
  expanded spelling before the raw text: the unexpanded `${HOME}/.npmrc` yields
  a bare `/.npmrc` because `}` is a token edge the same way `$` is, and without
  the reorder that tail would be reported in place of the `~/.npmrc` prefix the
  expansion resolves to — the parity #985 exists to protect. Nothing that was
  blocked before stopped being blocked
  ([#981](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/981)).

- `agentos skills update` enforces the security scan that `skills install`
  enforces. `SkillInstaller.update()` called `self.install(..., force=True)`,
  and `force=True` is exactly the flag that bypasses the scan verdict, so
  updating a skill installed dangerous content that a fresh install of the same
  skill would have refused. `update()` now passes `force=False`. The reporting
  half is fixed with it: `_handle_skills_update` built its result from
  `success`, `name` and `message` and dropped the `scan` object entirely, so a
  caller had no way to see why an update was refused — it now carries
  `scan_verdict` and `scan_findings` when present, matching
  `_handle_skills_install`, and the CLI prints the verdict
  ([#988](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/988)).

- `web_search` fences result titles and snippets before the model reads them.
  Every other path that pulls remote text into the model's context wraps it in
  the untrusted envelope — `web_fetch.py`, `web.py`, `browser.py` — and
  `_search_payload` passed `title` and `snippet` through raw. Those two fields
  are written by whoever ranks for the query, so an attacker who gets a page
  ranked for a query the agent runs landed unfenced text next to the operator's
  own instructions; #688 shipped the `source` tag but not this half. The tool
  result now wraps each result's `title` and `snippet` in
  `wrap_untrusted_boundary`, tagged with that result's own URL and falling back
  to the provider tag and then the tool name. `url` and `source` are untouched,
  so links stay clickable and the existing origin tag keeps working
  ([#1132](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1132)).

- `~/.config/gh`, `~/.anthropic`, `~/.openai` and `~/.vault-token` join
  `_SENSITIVE_PREFIXES`. The denylist already guarded `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`,
  `~/.azure`, `~/.config/gcloud`, `~/.docker/config`, `~/.kube`, `~/.npmrc`,
  `~/.pypirc`, `~/.netrc`, `~/.gnupg` and `~/.password-store`, but none of
  those four. `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` is the one that matters most: AgentOS
  agents run `gh` routinely, so a live GitHub token sat in a path the sandbox
  did not consider sensitive, immediately beside an entry that already protects
  `~/.npmrc` ([#1138](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1138)).

## [2026.9.7] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Day-of-week ranges that end at `SUN` parse again. `_parse_field` substituted
  every day name with a single number, and `sun` is always 0 there, so
  `SAT-SUN` reached the range check as `6-0` and `MON-SUN` as `1-0` — reversed
  ranges, rejected with `CronParseError: Range start > end in field
  'day_of_week'`. POSIX cron spells Sunday both 0 and 7 and reads the trailing
  one as 7, which the parser already honoured for the numeric spelling: `WED-7`
  worked while the `WED-SUN` a user would actually type did not. Names are now
  substituted per token instead of by whole-string replace, so a `SUN` at the
  upper bound of a range resolves to 7 unless the range already starts at
  Sunday — `SAT-SUN` is `{0, 6}`, `MON-SUN` the whole week, and `SUN-WED` /
  `SUN-SUN` keep the days they name
  ([#1063](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1063)).
- A JSON-RPC error whose `error` member is not an object no longer kills the
  command with an `AttributeError`. `RpcError.__init__` in
  `senior-unilp-manager` and `poolsdotfun-token-launcher` read the payload as
  a dict unconditionally — `error.get("message", error)`. The spec says
  `error` is an object, but nodes and proxies really do answer with a bare
  string (`{"error": "rate limit exceeded"}`) or null, and each of those
  raised `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'` *inside the
  exception constructor*, so the traceback escaped every `except RpcError`
  that `plan.py`, `pools_write.py` and `rpc.batch()` already have. `batch()`
  was the worst case: a per-call error is meant to land in its own result slot
  so one bad pool cannot abort a 40-pool sweep, and a string payload aborted
  it anyway. The constructor now reads `code`/`data` only when the payload is
  a mapping and falls back to the payload itself for the message, matching
  what `robinhood-chain-stocks` already does; `raw` still carries whatever
  came back and the dict path is unchanged
  ([#974](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/974)).
- Bundled skill scripts refuse endpoints that are not `http(s)`. Every one of
  them reaches `urllib.request.urlopen`, which speaks `file:`, `ftp:` and
  `data:` just as happily as HTTP, so an endpoint taken from argv or the
  environment was an arbitrary local-file read: `watch_http_json.py --url
  file:///etc/passwd` reported the file's contents on every cron tick, and
  `--rpc file://…` did the same through the `poolsdotfun-token-launcher` and
  `senior-unilp-manager` JSON-RPC clients. The `senior-unilp-manager` client
  was doubly exposed — it took `rpc_url or resolve_rpc_url(chain)`, so an
  override skipped the resolver and every check in it. Each entry point now
  validates the scheme and host with `urlsplit` before the URL reaches
  `urlopen`, matching the guard `robinhood-chain-stocks` already carries, and
  the watcher tests serve their fixtures over loopback HTTP instead of
  `file://` ([#1065](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1065)).
- The sensitive-path denylist now expands `$VAR`/`${VAR}` before it decides,
  so the hard block cannot be side-stepped by spelling a home directory as a
  variable. Tool dispatch ends in a shell, so `cat $HOME/.ssh/config` reaches
  the syscall as `~/.ssh/config` while the scanner only ever saw the literal
  text — a display-vs-executor drift that gave all 19 entries in
  `_SENSITIVE_PREFIXES` a second, unguarded spelling. The leading `$` is
  stripped as a token edge, so `$HOME/.ssh/config` arrived at the matcher as
  the relative-looking `HOME/.ssh/config` and faced only the narrow
  leaf-marker fallback; `cat $HOME/.aws/credentials`, `cp $HOME/.kube/config
  /tmp/leak.txt`, `cat ${HOME}/.gnupg/secring.gpg` and `rm -rf $HOME/.ssh` all
  ran at the real `exec_command` boundary, past a block that is meant to
  survive user approval. `sensitive_path_marker()` expands before choosing a
  matcher, `sensitive_path_in_text()` re-scans the expanded text when the
  literal scan comes up empty, and `_is_root_target()` expands for the same
  reason — `rm -rf $ROOTDIR` is a root wipe the literal text hides. Undefined
  names are left as written, so nothing new matches on a host where the
  variable does not exist, and the workspace exception still applies to the
  expanded path
  ([#985](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/985)).
- `agentos upgrade` keeps the operator's real `PATH` on Windows. Windows
  environment variables are case-insensitive and the OS spells the search path
  `Path`, but `hardened_path_env` copied the environment into a plain dict —
  which is case-*sensitive* — then read `env.get("PATH", "")` and got nothing.
  It wrote the fallback login dirs back under a brand-new `PATH` key, so the
  environment carried two competing variables and the one the upgrade
  subprocess reads no longer contained `uv`, `pipx`, or anything else the user
  had installed. `resolve_tool` compounded it by reading `hardened["PATH"]`
  directly: the miss handed `shutil.which` a `None` path, falling back to the
  un-hardened process environment the helper exists to replace. Both now
  resolve the key case-insensitively on Windows and write back to whichever
  spelling was already there; POSIX still treats `PATH` and `Path` as the
  different variables they are
  ([#1069](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1069)).
- A tool result too large for the whole disk budget is refused before the
  store is pruned, instead of after every record in it has been deleted.
  `_prune_to_fit` took the oldest records off one at a time chasing room for a
  snapshot that could never fit, and raised `ToolResultStoreBudgetError` only
  once the store was empty; the caller in `agent.py` logs a `skipped` metric
  and carries on, so unrelated records went to zero with nothing in the
  transcript to say so. The budget check now runs first and nothing on disk is
  touched. Pruning is unchanged for writes that can fit — the oldest records
  still come off, and only as many as needed — and the trailing raise it
  replaces was unreachable in every other case, since an emptied store always
  satisfies the loop's own exit test
  ([#996](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/996)).
- The browser `eval` SSRF pre-scan now sees obfuscated targets. It matched
  only literal `http(s)://` text, so three spellings of a private or
  cloud-metadata URL reached the evaluator unblocked: protocol-relative
  `fetch('//169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/')`, which inherits the page's
  scheme and lands on exactly the same address; the loopback form
  `fetch('//127.0.0.1:8080/admin')`; and a protocol split across literals,
  `fetch('htt' + 'p://169.254.169.254/…')`. This scan is the *only* network
  guard the eval action gets — the post-eval page-URL recheck fires when the
  page navigates, and a direct `fetch` never navigates — while the denylist
  layer that would otherwise catch `fetch` is opt-in and off by default. The
  scan now also screens protocol-relative targets and the concatenation of
  every decoded string literal, reusing the split-token technique the denylist
  already had. A protocol-relative target is read only from a string literal
  that is entirely the URL, so a `//` line comment stays a comment, and a
  candidate the scan *derived* rather than read counts only once its host
  resolves to a private or metadata address — otherwise `'base' + '//a/b'`
  would be refused as readily as `'//127.0.0.1/x'`
  ([#1092](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1092)).
- `code_exec` removes its ephemeral working directory on every exit, not just
  the one path that happened to own the cleanup. `execute_code` creates the
  directory with `tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix="agentos_exec_")` whenever no
  workspace is configured, but the `shutil.rmtree` hung off the `finally` of
  the non-sandbox branch alone. Every exit from the sandbox branch — gate
  denial, a backend that raised, an escalation denial, a subprocess timeout, a
  spawn error, and the success path too — returned past it and left one
  directory behind per call, growing without bound on a long-running agent.
  The whole execution now sits inside the try whose `finally` owns the
  cleanup, so there is one exit path for the tempdir instead of six that skip
  it. A configured workspace still sets no `cleanup_dir` and is never removed
  ([#1010](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1010)).
- A replacement agent task stays in `AgentTaskRegistry` when its predecessor
  finishes winding down. Cancellation is not synchronous: `register()` may put
  a new task under a session key while the cancelled one is still settling,
  and the predecessor's done-callback then popped the key unconditionally —
  evicting a task that is still running. Abort and status queries went blind
  to it, so a session could be left with an unreachable agent turn that no
  later cancel could reach. `_on_done` now removes the entry only when the
  registry still holds the task the callback belongs to, leaving a replacement
  registered
  ([#1026](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1026)).
- `code_exec` blocks destructive calls reached through `compile`, `getattr`
  and `builtins.__import__`. The AST scan added in #848 read `eval`/`exec`
  arguments as string expressions only, so wrapping the same source in a code
  carrier walked straight past it: `exec(compile("import os; os.remove('/x')",
  "<s>", "exec"))` was allowed, and so was the renamed carrier `c = compile;
  exec(c(...))`. Two more spellings of the same call bypassed the module
  resolver — `getattr(os, "sys" + "tem")("rm -rf /")`, whose callee is a
  `Call` rather than an `Attribute` and therefore never reached the attribute
  branch, and `builtins.__import__("os")` / `getattr(builtins,
  "__import__")("os")`, which the resolver only recognised in its bare
  `__import__` spelling. `_eval_const_str` now resolves a `compile(...)` call
  to its `source` argument (positional or keyword) with local aliases tracked
  through `visit_Assign`, a new `_resolve_getattr_target` resolves both halves
  of a `getattr` statically, and the module resolver accepts `__import__`
  through an attribute or a dynamically fetched callee
  ([#1102](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1102)).
- The fork-bomb hard block matches the fork bomb. `:(){ :|:& };:` was written
  into `_HARD_BLOCK_PATTERNS` as a raw string, so `re` read `(){ :\|:& }` as a
  *group* and `{ … }` as a quantifier: the pattern compiled to an empty
  capture followed by literal text, and the classic one-liner a scheduled
  prompt could carry went unblocked. The parens, braces and separators are now
  escaped and joined with `\s*`, so the bomb is caught with or without the
  whitespace variations it is usually pasted with
  ([#998](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/998)).
- `read_spreadsheet` no longer shreds CSV and TSV rows that contain a
  multiline quoted field. `_read_delimited_rows` handed `csv.reader` the
  output of `text.splitlines()`, which cuts on the newline *inside* a quoted
  cell — a perfectly valid `"line one\nline two"` address or note field became
  two half-parsed rows, silently misaligning every column after it. The reader
  now consumes an `io.StringIO` over the whole text, which is what
  `csv.reader` expects, so embedded newlines stay inside their cell
  ([#1023](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1023)).
- A Markdown table with a ragged row renders on Telegram instead of raising.
  `_render_table` unpacked two-column rows as `label, value = row` and used
  `zip(..., strict=True)` for wider ones, so any row whose cell count differed
  from the header — routine in model-generated Markdown, where a trailing
  empty cell or an extra pipe is common — raised `ValueError` out of the
  formatter and cost the user the whole message. Rows are now padded or
  truncated to the header's column count, and the parser stops discarding the
  remainder of a table at the first ragged row
  ([#1031](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1031)).
- Microsoft Teams streaming sends the text of the chunk it was called for.
  The `_send` closure read `accumulated` from the enclosing scope while its
  sibling `_edit` bound the same value as a default argument; because the
  callback runs inside `adapter.continue_conversation` after the loop has
  moved on, the first message of a stream could go out carrying a later
  chunk's text — or, if the turn finished first, the whole answer duplicated.
  `_send` now binds the text by value the way `_edit` does
  ([#1046](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1046)).
- `agentos skills publish` reports a failed fork as a failure and exits
  non-zero. The publisher called `gh repo fork` and then `await proc.wait()`
  without ever reading the return code, so a missing `gh` auth, a rate limit
  or a repo that cannot be forked still produced `Fork created, use branch
  'skill/<name>' to submit` — advice for a fork that does not exist. The CLI
  compounded it by printing `Failed:` and exiting 0, so scripted publishes
  reported success. The fork's exit status and stderr are now checked and
  surfaced in the message, and the command raises `typer.Exit(1)` on failure
  ([#1050](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1050)).
- Bundled skill scripts create the parent directory of their `--out` /
  `--output` path. Seven entry points — `docx`, `xlsx`, `pdf-toolkit`,
  `multi-search-engine`, and the `robinhood-chain-stocks` and
  `robinhood-rwa-addresses` card writers — went straight to `write_text`, so
  the natural `--out reports/summary.json` died with `FileNotFoundError` after
  the expensive work was already done, losing the result. Each now calls
  `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` on the parent before writing
  ([#1055](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/1055)).

## [2026.9.6] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- Two commands AgentOS printed or documented now work when followed.
  `docs/cli.md` and `README.product.md` told users to run `agentos config set
  gateway.port 18791`; there is no `[gateway]` table — the listen port is
  top-level `port` on `GatewayConfig`, which is `extra = forbid` — so the
  copy-pasted line exited 1 with `Key not found` and never changed the port.
  Both examples now say `agentos config set port 18791`. They deliberately do
  not pass `--config ~/.agentos/config.toml`: `resolve_config_path()` loads the
  *first* of `AGENTOS_GATEWAY_CONFIG_PATH`, `./agentos.toml` and
  `~/.agentos/config.toml` that exists, so hardcoding the last of the three
  writes to a file the gateway may not read — exiting 0 and printing "Restart
  the gateway to apply this setting" while the port silently does not change,
  which is harder to debug than the original error. Separately, `channels add`
  and `channels edit` printed `Verify: uv run agentos channels status <name>
  --json`; `uv` is not present on a pipx or pip install — both documented
  install methods — so that hint exited 127, while the line directly above it
  already printed a plain `agentos gateway restart`. The `uv run ` prefix is
  dropped. A test now runs every `agentos config set` example in both docs
  files through the CLI and fails if one does not exit 0
  ([#840](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/840),
  [#835](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/835)).
- Memory search stops re-scanning the workspace on every query once a session
  delta is pending. `MemorySyncManager.sync()` lets a pending delta bypass the
  clean-search fast path, but it consumed that delta only when a session
  indexer was configured. Session indexing is off by default, and with it off
  `_do_session_sync()` is a successful no-op, so nothing ever cleared the
  delta: after a single message every later search took the slow path and
  walked the workspace tree again, even with no new messages and no file
  changes. The reset now keys off whether the sync succeeded rather than
  whether an indexer exists, so one completed search-time sync settles the
  delta and the next unchanged search takes the fast path. New message
  notifications, dirty file state, and `force=True` still sync as before, and
  an enabled indexer that fails mid-search still keeps its delta pending for
  the next retry
  ([#956](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/956)).
- Turn admission reserves spend headroom instead of only checking it, so a
  concurrent subagent fan-out can no longer overshoot a `[budgets]` ceiling by
  the width of the fan-out. Spend is recorded by `UsageTracker.add()` only as a
  turn burns tokens, so children dispatched at once by `SubagentManager.spawn`
  all read the same pre-fan-out snapshot and all cleared the same limit — with
  `max_concurrent=5`, five full turns past a ceiling the code documented as
  bounded by one. `UsageTracker.reserve_turn_budget()` now checks and reserves
  in a single synchronous call and books the hold against every ledger scope
  the session bills to (session, gateway daily, agent daily, channel daily);
  `TurnRunner._run_turn` releases it in a `finally`, so success, error,
  cancellation, and an abandoned turn all hand the headroom straight back. The
  hold is sized by the new `budgets.turn_reservation` key (default `$0.25`,
  `0` to opt out), and because it lives only for its own turn it never shrinks
  a ceiling for turns that run one after another. The re-check between
  iterations inside a turn still weighs recorded spend only, so no turn is
  stopped by its own reservation
  ([#823](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/823)).
- The bundled `gmgn-holder-analysis` script prints usage instead of crashing
  when it is run without arguments. `analyze.py` read `sys.argv[1]` and
  `sys.argv[2]` at import time with no length check, so `analyze.py` on its own
  and `analyze.py --help` both died with an unhandled `IndexError` traceback
  rather than telling the caller what the script wants. It now answers `-h` and
  `--help` on stdout with exit 0, and a missing token address or chain with
  `Usage: analyze.py <token_address> <chain> [zh|en]` on stderr and exit 2 —
  the same guard its sibling `gmgn-wallet-score` script already carries
  ([#957](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/957)).
- The MCP `stdio` client speaks the transport's newline framing instead of
  LSP-style `Content-Length` headers. `MCPStdioClient` wrote
  `Content-Length: N\r\n\r\n<body>` to the server's stdin and rejected any
  reply that did not carry the same header (`Missing Content-Length header in
  response`), so no spec-compliant MCP stdio server could be used at all —
  the reference `@modelcontextprotocol/server-*` implementations included.
  Requests now go out as one compact JSON-RPC object per line, and a reply is
  read up to the newline delimiter and matched to its request id, so a server
  that interleaves `notifications/message` or `notifications/tools/list_changed`
  with its replies is followed rather than being reported as the result of
  whichever request was in flight. The existing short-read guarantees are kept:
  a message split across pipe writes is reassembled rather than truncated, and
  EOF before the delimiter raises a clear error instead of reaching
  `json.loads` as a partial line. A message past the 64 KiB asyncio pipe
  buffer — a large tool result, or a `tools/list` from a large catalog — is
  read whole, where `readline` would raise and discard it, and a server that
  never sends a delimiter is cut off at 16 MiB rather than buffered without
  bound ([#894](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/894)).
- The bundled `gmgn-wallet-score` copy-trade backtest reports `$0.00` for a
  wallet at exactly 0% return instead of a six-figure fantasy. `score.py`
  floored the wallet's per-trade return with `wallet_pct or 0.0001`, but
  `wallet_pct` is always a float, so `or` only ever fired on an exact `0.0` —
  a real break-even wallet, or a dev wallet whose `bought_cost` is 0 and whose
  ROI the API reports as 0. That 0.0001 then became the divisor in
  `copy_7d = realized_profit * (copy_pct / wallet_pct)`, so a wallet that
  realised $800 on no recorded cost was printed as a $567K copy-trade gain and
  one that lost $500 as a $567K profit — sign and magnitude both wrong, in the
  headline number the report shows the user. The floor is gone; the
  `if wallet_pct else 0.0` guard already next to it now handles a genuine zero,
  and the clamp still bounds the blow-up the surrounding comment was about
  ([#971](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/971)).
- The MCP bridge clamps the arguments an MCP client supplies instead of
  forwarding them to the gateway verbatim. `events_wait` caps `timeout_ms` at
  5 minutes — applied before the deadline is computed, so the cap reaches
  `recv_event` — and `max_events` at 10,000; `conversations_list` and
  `messages_read` (and therefore the `transcript_export` tool) clamp `limit`
  into `1..5000`. These arguments were unclamped, or lower-clamped only, and
  they are chosen by a model on every call: a `timeout_ms=3_600_000` held the
  tool call for an hour, indistinguishable from a stuck gateway, and a negative
  `conversations_list` limit reached SQLite as `LIMIT -1`, which means *no*
  limit and loaded every session row. The `messages_read` ceiling is defence in
  depth — the gateway already normalises `chat.history` into `1..200`. Clamping
  is silent, so a badly chosen argument degrades instead of surfacing a tool
  error ([#685](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/685)).
- Every session removal path drops the in-memory runtime state keyed by that
  session, not just `SessionManager.finish()`. `sessions.delete` (the Web UI
  "Delete Chat"), `SessionManager.cap_entries()`, `prune_stale()` and the cron
  `SessionReaper` all went straight to `storage.delete_session()`, leaving
  orphaned entries in three process-global stores — `SpawnGroupTracker`'s
  closed/woken sets, the Pilot router's per-session routing history, and the
  per-parent spawn locks. On a gateway that stays up for weeks, every deleted
  or pruned session leaked another entry with nothing to bound the growth.
  Eviction now lives in `agentos.session.runtime_state`, is idempotent, and
  runs on all of them. `sessions.delete` also cancels and drains the session's
  active and queued tasks first, so an in-flight turn handler can no longer
  write to a session whose rows are about to disappear or repopulate the state
  just evicted; `prune_stale` collects the stale keys via the new
  `SessionStorage.list_stale_session_keys()` before deleting, since the
  storage-level prune returned only a count
  ([#750](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/750)).
- The legacy MCP `sse` transport follows the 2024-11-05 HTTP+SSE lifecycle
  instead of inverting it. `MCPSSEClient.connect()` POSTed the `initialize`
  request before any stream existed, sent it to a guessed `/message` path, and
  then opened a fresh `GET` per request — so a compliant server, which picks its
  own message URI and announces it in an `endpoint` event on a stream the client
  must open first, either rejected the handshake or emitted the response into a
  window with nothing listening. The client now drives `mcp.client.sse`, the
  sibling of the SDK transport the Streamable HTTP client already uses: the
  stream opens first, the advertised endpoint is resolved against the configured
  URL and is the only POST target, one receive stream serves the connection with
  responses correlated by JSON-RPC id, and `close()` cancels the reader task. An
  endpoint pointing at a different origin is refused before anything is posted,
  and both channels — the stream and the POST — dial through the same
  connect-time SSRF guard as before, which matters more now that the server
  chooses the POST target. The handshake is bounded by `tool_timeout_seconds`,
  so a server that opens the stream and never advertises an endpoint fails
  instead of hanging the caller. The unused `MCPServerConfig.message_endpoint`
  field, which no configuration surface ever set, is gone
  ([#922](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/922)).
- Both SDK-backed MCP HTTP transports open and unwind their transport in a task
  the client owns. The SDK transports and `ClientSession` are built on anyio
  task groups, and an anyio cancel scope may only be exited by the task that
  entered it — but nothing closes an MCP client from the task that opened it:
  `discover_and_register` runs during boot or in an RPC handler while
  `close_active_clients` runs from gateway shutdown or a later `mcp.disconnect`.
  Closing therefore raised `RuntimeError: Attempted to exit cancel scope in a
  different task`, which `close_active_clients` swallows, leaking the stream and
  its connection for the life of the process. This was already reachable on
  `streamable_http`; the shared `MCPSessionClient` base fixes it for both
  ([#922](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/922)).

### Security

- Cron webhook delivery POSTs through the connect-time SSRF guard, closing the
  DNS-rebinding TOCTOU window the fetch-tool conversion left open on this path.
  `validate_webhook_url` resolves the hostname once and clears it;
  the plain `httpx.AsyncClient` that followed resolved the same name again when
  it dialled, so a short-TTL domain could answer with a public address for the
  check and with `169.254.169.254` for the socket — handing the job id, job name
  and run summary to the cloud metadata service. Delivery now uses
  `ssrf_guarded_client(validator=validate_metadata_only_address)`, which dials
  the address it validated, on the first attempt and on every `retry_request`
  retry. The URL check stays in front of it for the legible `invalid webhook
  URL` message at add time, and the metadata-only floor keeps localhost and LAN
  hooks (n8n and friends) working. As with the fetch tools, the guard covers the
  default connection pool only: a request routed through a configured `HTTP_PROXY`
  is resolved by the proxy rather than in-process, so there is no local rebinding
  window there to close
  ([#725](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/725)).
- The Telegram webhook verifies its secret token in constant time.
  `TelegramChannel._handle_webhook` compared the inbound
  `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header with `!=`, which returns as soon as
  two bytes differ; the response latency then tracks how long a prefix matched,
  letting an unauthenticated remote caller recover the configured token one
  byte at a time and post forged updates into the channel. The header now goes
  through `hmac.compare_digest` over UTF-8 bytes, with a missing header
  treated as an empty candidate rather than skipping the comparison — the same
  guarantee `gateway/auth.py` and `channels/slack.py` already give
  ([#962](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/962)).
- The intent approval cache grades a delete by how destructive it is, so an
  approval never silently covers a stronger operation on the same path. Flags
  were dropped during normalisation, which made `rm /tmp/logs` and
  `rm -rf /tmp/logs` the same cache key: approving the first — a no-op on a
  directory, since plain `rm` refuses it — let the second run without a prompt,
  and `-rf` had never appeared on anything the user saw. The key now carries a
  capability set — `recursive`, `parents`, `force` — parsed from
  `-r`/`-R`/`-f`/`--recursive`/`--force` (bundles, flags after the target, the
  `--` terminator, and the abbreviations `getopt_long` accepts all handled) and
  from the Python spelling: `shutil.rmtree` is recursive, `os.removedirs` is
  recursive *and* prunes empty ancestors, `os.remove`, `os.rmdir` and
  `Path.unlink` are neither. A cached approval satisfies a retry only when its
  capability set is a superset, which keeps the module's reason for existing
  intact: every shell-to-Python paraphrase still short-circuits — `rm X` covers
  `os.remove("X")`, `rm -r X` and `rm -rf X` both cover `shutil.rmtree("X")` —
  so retries at the same destructiveness do not re-prompt. `/forget <path>`
  clears every grade for the path, not just the plain one
  ([#849](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/849)).
- The bundled `robinhood-rwa-addresses` lookup pins `--rpc-url` to `http` and
  `https`, closing a local-file read. `rwa_lookup.py` passed the flag straight
  into `urllib.request.urlopen` under a blanket `# noqa: S310` — and `urlopen`
  also speaks `file:`, `ftp:` and `data:`, so `--rpc-url file:///etc/hosts`
  made the process read and parse that path. In an agent workflow the endpoint
  can be steered by model output, which turns an unchecked flag into arbitrary
  local reads. A new `validate_rpc_url()` applies the same scheme allowlist the
  bundled `http_fetch` script uses: `main()` rejects a bad scheme with a usage
  error and exit 2 before any network or filesystem work, and `_rpc_batch()`
  re-checks at the one call site that reaches `urlopen`, so no caller can route
  around it ([#968](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/968)).

## [2026.9.5] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Direct provider endpoints price from native vendor rates instead of falling
  through to the `_DEFAULT_PRICING` placeholder. Bare model ids without a vendor
  prefix (`deepseek-chat`, `deepseek-reasoner`, `gemini-2.0-flash`) and
  date-stamped snapshots (`claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`, `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`)
  failed the `startswith` prefix scan and were billed at $3.00/$15.00 per 1M
  tokens — up to a 21x error in usage tracking and spend rollup for a cheap
  model. Direct rates for DeepSeek, Anthropic, Google Gemini and OpenAI are now
  registered alongside their prompt-cache read discounts
  (`cached_input_per_m`), snapshot suffixes are stripped before lookup, and
  candidate normalisation is provider-aware. Resolution is scoped to direct
  endpoints, so aggregator routing and the existing static table baseline are
  unchanged, and Opus keeps its tiered rates
  ([#842](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/842)).

### Fixed

- `TaskRuntime` retains the cached routing envelope while a session has queued
  or running tasks, evicting it only after the final task for the session reaches
  a terminal state. This prevents proactive or follow-up sends from losing
  channel, account, recipient, and thread routing during multi-turn workflows
  ([#930](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/930)).
- `SessionStorage` serializes every runtime method that can commit on the shared
  SQLite connection. Two coroutines writing concurrently could interleave inside
  a multi-statement transaction — one committing another's half-written state —
  and a mutating method that raised or was cancelled left the transaction open
  for whoever committed next. Write ownership is now held across a complete
  transaction and an open transaction is rolled back when the method exits with
  an exception, cancellation included. Migration writes stay outside the lock:
  they run sequentially during connect, before the storage instance is exposed
  ([#891](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/891)).
- `JobStore.transaction()` rolls back on any `BaseException` instead of leaving
  uncommitted writes in the shared connection's buffer for a later caller to
  commit, and a task-bound reentrant write lock serializes `save`, `delete`,
  `save_execution`, `prune_runs` and `_reserve_job_for_run` so a concurrent
  writer can no longer commit incomplete batch state out from under an open
  transaction. Intermediate commits are deferred while a transaction is active
  ([#964](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/964)).
- `SessionWriteLock` evicts a session's entry on `release()` when no acquirer is
  queued behind it. `_locks` never removed anything, so a long-running gateway
  retained one `asyncio.Lock` per unique session key for the life of the
  process; the dict is now bounded by currently active keys rather than every
  key ever seen. Entries with queued waiters are kept so lock handoff is
  unaffected ([#966](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/966)).
- Auto Pilot falls back across the configured router tiers when a model times
  out or returns a pre-content error, instead of retrying the same dead endpoint
  three times and freezing the turn for roughly six minutes. Transport timeouts
  are classified apart from transient blips, the timeout retry is capped at one,
  a `provider_timeout_retry` warning is emitted, the fallback chain is derived
  from the active router tiers, and the terminal error now names the `/c0`,
  `/c2` and `/auto` escapes
  ([#860](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/860)).
- The session FTS query sanitizer keeps non-ASCII letters. `[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]`
  stripped every accented Latin, CJK, Cyrillic, Vietnamese and Arabic character
  before the query reached FTS5, so `café déploiement` searched for
  `"caf" "d" "ploiement"` and `中文 报告` searched for nothing at all — while the
  transcripts themselves were indexed correctly. The pattern is now the
  Unicode-aware `[^\w\s]`, which still strips FTS5 operators
  ([#903](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/903)).
- The Discord adapter no longer cancels itself while reconnecting. When
  `_heartbeat_loop()` detected a missed ACK and drove a reconnect,
  `_do_reconnect()` unconditionally cancelled `self._heartbeat_task` — the very
  task it was running inside — so the coroutine died at the next `await` during
  socket cleanup, before a new WebSocket or a replacement heartbeat task
  existed. The cancel is now skipped when the heartbeat task is
  `asyncio.current_task()`; externally initiated reconnects and adapter
  shutdown still cancel it
  ([#882](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/882)).
- `list_dir` survives a broken symlink. A dangling link is not a directory, so
  the size lookup fell through to `entry.stat()`, which follows the link and
  raised an unhandled `FileNotFoundError` that took down the whole listing. The
  size query now falls back to `entry.lstat().st_size`, or `0`, on `OSError`
  ([#844](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/844)).
- `agentos cost --export <path>` creates missing parent directories instead of
  raising `FileNotFoundError`, matching what `render_savings_pdf` already did.
  Both the JSON and CSV branches are covered
  ([#846](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/846)).
- The gateway debounce buffer is capped at 50 coalesced messages per
  `session_key` and flushes immediately on reaching the cap, rather than
  accumulating without bound. The cap-triggered flush retains its delivery task
  and drains it on shutdown
  ([#796](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/796)).
- Named artifact delivery falls back to a valid filename leaf. When an
  artifact's metadata carried an empty, whitespace, root or dot-relative target
  (`""`, `"   "`, `"/"`, `"."`, `".."`), `Path(filename).name` resolved to `""`
  and the delivery target became the temporary directory itself — the hardlink
  failed with `FileExistsError` and the `shutil.copy2` fallback handed
  `send_file` a directory path. The leaf is now sanitized, falling back to the
  source name or `artifact`
  ([#742](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/742)).
- `robinhood-chain-stocks` withholds price and holding value for a contract it
  has already disproven. When `uiMultiplier()` reverted — `isStockToken: false`,
  which `SKILL.md` documents as "not a Stock Token, do not hand over the
  address" — an impersonator reusing a listed ticker still had the real
  company's live Chainlink feed attached to it, and `holding.valueUsd`
  calculated from it, lending a proven fake the credibility of a real price.
  Price and USD holding value are now withheld with a `readErrors` explanation;
  `isStockToken: null` still resolves a price, because an unreachable RPC node
  is not proof of fakery
  ([#866](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/866)).

### Security

- `code_exec` detects destructive calls through the AST, not just the regex
  fast path. `_check_code_destructive` matched shallow patterns only, so
  reflection and dynamic-import constructs reached the host filesystem without
  passing the approval gate: `getattr(os, "rem" + "ove")(path)`,
  `__import__("os").remove(path)`, `importlib.import_module("os").remove(path)`,
  `exec`/`eval` of a destructive string, `from os import *`, aliased imports and
  aliased functions. A visitor now runs whenever the regex does not match,
  resolving statically computable strings (constants, concatenations, f-string
  values), tracking imports and aliases for `os`, `shutil`, `pathlib`,
  `subprocess` and `importlib`, and flagging dynamic `getattr` and `__import__`
  targets. The layer is additive — existing pattern coverage is unchanged
  ([#848](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/848)).

## [2026.9.4] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- `agentos config set skills.config.<skill>.<key>` persists again. `_set_key`
  only overwrote keys already present in `to_toml_dict()`, and an empty
  `skills.config` is omitted there for rollback compatibility, so the documented
  command could never create the map. Missing intermediate dicts are now created
  under `skills.config` only, and unknown keys outside that map stay rejected.
  The no-`--config` path stopped lying too: it printed a fabricated
  `AGENTOS_GATEWAY_` export and exited 0 for keys that do not bind — including
  `gateway.port` and every `skills.config.*` key — so a user followed the hint
  and set an environment variable that nothing reads. Keys are validated against
  the model first, and the free-form `skills.config` map, which has no env
  binding, is refused outright
  ([#834](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/834)).
- `load_entries` skips malformed lines in the decisions JSONL instead of raising
  on the first one. The file is append-only and written once per turn, so a
  SIGKILL mid-turn, an OOM or a disk-full error can leave a truncated line
  behind — and `load_entries` is the shared reader for cost-savings reports,
  session export and pipeline replay, all of which died together. The realistic
  corruption is not a bad string but a wrong-shape payload, which surfaces as
  `ValueError`/`TypeError` out of `_filter_payload` rather than
  `JSONDecodeError`, so all of them are caught. Skips are accounted for: one
  debug event per line with path, line number and error class, and one warning
  with the totals at the end, so a partial report announces itself instead of
  quietly under-reporting. This matches the tolerance
  `decision_log_aggregate.parse_log_line` already had, so the two readers of the
  same file now agree on what is fatal
  ([#812](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/812)).
- An MCP client disconnecting no longer takes another client's tool with it.
  When two servers registered the same tool name, disconnect unregistered the
  name unconditionally, so the surviving client's tool vanished from the
  registry. Each active client's exact registry spec and handler are tracked; a
  colliding tool is unregistered only when the disconnecting client owns the
  active handler, and otherwise the most recently registered handler from a
  still-active client is restored
  ([#801](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/801)).
- `background_process` output is capped at 1,000,000 retained characters per
  session, evicting older chunks so the most recent tail survives. Draining
  continues past the cap, so a noisy subprocess cannot block on a full pipe, and
  the retained character count and truncation state are exposed in the process
  session and log payloads
  ([#803](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/803)).
- Provider credit exhaustion is classified as `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS` rather than
  a transient fault. OpenAI returns `insufficient_quota` with HTTP 429, which
  read as `RATE_LIMITED` and tripped the circuit breaker for a billing fault no
  cooldown can heal; Anthropic returns `billing_error` with HTTP 402, which read
  as `UNKNOWN` and carried no recovery hint. A cross-provider
  `_is_insufficient_credits()` check runs before the status-code branch, so the
  raw code and message win over the ambiguous 429
  ([#777](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/777)).
- CLI JSON output survives a non-UTF-8 terminal encoding.
  `json.dumps(..., ensure_ascii=False)` emits raw non-ASCII, and on a Windows
  code page (cp1252, cp437) `sys.stdout.write` raised `UnicodeEncodeError`.
  `_write_json_text` writes UTF-8 bytes to the underlying binary buffer when one
  exists — lossless, so the JSON contract holds for pipes and files — and falls
  back to the text layer with `errors="backslashreplace"`, which keeps the data
  as round-trippable `\uXXXX` escapes instead of destroying an em dash into `?`
  ([#764](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/764)).
- Memory-write refresh callbacks reach the running turn.
  `build_turn_runner_from_services` never populated `svc._turn_runner_ref`, so
  `_on_memory_write` had nothing to call and `refresh_memory_snapshot(agent_id)`
  never ran on the active `TurnRunner`
  ([#761](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/761)).
- `apply_patch` records `UpdateFile` in `ctx.workspace_file_writes`. Only
  `AddFile` was recorded, so a patch that edited an existing file left the
  engine's auto-publish path with nothing to publish, even though `UpdateFile`
  is a peer of `AddFile` everywhere else in the module. The parser also accepts
  the optional line counts in a standard `@@ -a,b +c,d @@` hunk header
  ([#753](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/753)).
- `parse_version()` understands a bare `.dev` suffix and sorts dev
  pre-releases per PEP 440. There was a fallback defaulting a bare `.post` to
  `0` but none for `.dev`, so `2026.7.18.dev` parsed with `dev = None`, fell
  through to the final-release phase and compared equal to `2026.7.18` —
  suppressing the `is_newer()` update notice for every development install
  ([#740](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/740)).
- Email is marked seen after the message is converted, not before, so a failure
  mid-conversion leaves the message unread and eligible for the next poll
  ([#719](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/719)).
- `robinhood-chain-stocks` handles a non-dict RPC error payload. `_eth_call`
  assumed `error` was a mapping and crashed when a node returned a plain string
  ([#815](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/815)).
- `gmgn-wallet-score` prints usage instead of crashing. `score.py` indexed
  `sys.argv[1]` and `sys.argv[2]` unguarded, so running it with too few
  arguments raised an unhandled `IndexError`; it now validates argument count,
  exits 2 with usage on stderr, and answers `-h`/`--help` with exit 0
  ([#819](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/819)).
- Frontend line endings are normalised so Prettier stops failing on Windows
  checkouts. `.gitattributes` marks frontend sources `text=auto` — not a blanket
  `eol=lf`, which would have flagged PNG, webp and woff2 assets as text and
  corrupted them — and Prettier is configured with `endOfLine: "auto"`
  ([#825](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/825)).

### Security

- Invisible Unicode characters are normalised before intent-phrase matching. A
  soft hyphen, word joiner, zero-width space or bidi isolator placed between two
  words split the intent-phrase regexes, so a prompt-injection payload evaded
  the guard entirely in both report and enforce mode. `classify_injection` now
  normalises invisible codepoints to a space before matching the non-invisible
  patterns, while `invisible_char` is still matched against the original text so
  the smuggling technique itself is reported rather than erased
  ([#690](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/690)).
- Search results carry their provider origin, so text returned by a search
  backend is attributable when the injection guard inspects it
  ([#688](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/688)).
- Per-IP rate limiting covers the Control UI API subtree.
  `RateLimitMiddleware._is_ui_path()` exempted the entire Control UI prefix,
  including everything mounted under `{base_path}/api/*`, so
  `/control/api/sessions`, `/control/api/chat` and `/control/api/config` took
  unlimited unauthenticated requests. It now mirrors the check
  `AuthMiddleware._is_ui_path()` already had
  ([#748](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/748)).
- `send_file` checks file size before reading. Every channel adapter opened or
  read the file first, so a large attachment meant memory exhaustion — the
  email adapter base64-expands the whole payload in memory — or a long upload
  that ended in an API rejection. `check_channel_file_size` stats the file up
  front against each service's real ceiling (Discord 10 MB, Telegram 50 MB,
  email 25 MB) and raises with the limit named
  ([#683](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/683)).
- `robinhood-chain-stocks` rejects a non-`http(s)` `--rpc-url`. The URL reached
  the HTTP layer unvalidated, so a `file://` URL turned an RPC call into a local
  file read; empty URLs and a bare `http://` are refused as well
  ([#816](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/816)).

## [2026.9.3] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- **Inline card grids in Web chat** — a second AgentOS-native artifact mime,
  `application/vnd.agentos.cards+json`, alongside the existing chart one. A
  skill publishes a JSON payload and the transcript renders a responsive grid of
  record cards, each with an optional logo, a colour-coded status badge, and
  per-field copy buttons — instead of a download chip.

  This is the shape a markdown table handles badly: a 42-character contract
  address forces the table into a horizontal scroll, while a card gives the
  address its own line next to a copy button. `badgeTone` accepts
  `positive`/`warning`/`danger`/`neutral` and falls back to `neutral` for
  anything else, so a skill can introduce a new status without waiting on a
  frontend release. At most 24 cards render and the remainder are counted and
  reported under the grid rather than dropped silently.

  Every payload string reaches the DOM through `textContent`, never
  `innerHTML`, and `logo` is restricted to `http(s)` URLs — card fields carry
  on-chain metadata, which is attacker-controlled on a permissionless chain.

  `robinhood-rwa-addresses` is the first consumer: `scripts/rwa_cards.py` reads
  the lookup's JSON on stdin and emits the artifact, so an address answer in the
  Web UI arrives as a grid with the verification badge attached to each result.
  `docs/artifacts-and-media.md` documents the payload.

- **Skills publish their own artifacts.** `exec_command` now honours a
  `publish_artifact path=<file> mime=application/vnd.agentos.<x>+json` marker on
  a command's own output, so a skill that writes a chart or card payload gets it
  rendered without the model deciding to publish it. Live-testing the card
  renderer produced the same outcome seven times across two models: the script
  ran, the payload was written, and the answer came back as a hand-written
  markdown table with the artifact stranded in the workspace — a render that
  only happens when the model feels like it is not a contract.

  Only the `application/vnd.agentos.` family auto-publishes, so ordinary command
  output cannot push a workspace file at the user; a plain file still needs a
  deliberate `publish_artifact` call. The marker must own its line, so prose
  mentioning it is inert; at most four publish per command, with the overflow
  reported rather than dropped; and `publish_artifact`'s workspace containment
  is unchanged. The whole path is best-effort — a shell command never fails, and
  never loses its output, because a publish did not work out. This also fixes
  the existing `gmgn-token` and `gmgn-market` chart artifacts, which had the
  same failure mode. Both Robinhood skills now write their card payload on every
  run (`<SYMBOL>.cards.json`, marker on stderr so stdout stays pure JSON,
  `--no-cards` to opt out), and `robinhood-chain-stocks` gains
  `scripts/chain_cards.py`.

- Cards identify their subject with a locally drawn ticker monogram. The card
  grid has a logo slot, but the console's CSP is
  `img-src 'self' data: https://raw.githubusercontent.com`, so a token-list CDN
  image is blocked outright and the card was quietly dropping the broken `img`
  and showing nothing. Widening the CSP would also tell that CDN which tickers a
  user is researching, from their IP — a real leak on a finance surface, for
  decoration. The monogram needs no request and no trademarked artwork; the
  `logo` img is still attached and still takes over, but only on a real `load`,
  so an `error` now leaves the monogram standing instead of an empty slot.

### Fixed

- Telegram Bot API calls now retry `ConnectTimeout` and `PoolTimeout` alongside
  `ConnectError`. All three happen before any request bytes reach Telegram — a
  DNS/TLS handshake that never completed, or a wait for a pooled connection —
  but the two timeouts are `TimeoutException` siblings of `ConnectError` rather
  than subclasses, so `TelegramChannel._api()` dropped them into its generic
  `RequestError` branch and raised on the very first attempt with zero retries.
  `ReadTimeout` stays out of the retry path on purpose: by then the request is
  in flight, and re-sending a `getUpdates` long poll would double-poll it.
  ([#651](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/651))
- **`robinhood-rwa-addresses` now verifies every address against Robinhood
  Chain instead of trusting the token index.** The skill decided what counted
  as a genuine Stock Token from a name suffix in CoinGecko's list, which was
  wrong in both directions. CoinGecko caps `name` at 60 characters, so long
  listings lost the "• Robinhood Token" marker mid-word and were dropped
  entirely — `--query IBM` returned no matches at all, as did VTI, XLK, CTSH
  and CRDO. In the other direction, 47 of the 238 entries the skill reported as
  verified Stock Tokens (JPM, MCD, DIS, UBER, ABNB, PYPL and others) have **no
  contract deployed at the advertised address**; the skill handed them out as
  usable addresses, and funds sent to one would be unrecoverable.

  Discovery still ranks candidates from the token list, but the answer is now
  settled on chain: every genuine Stock Token is a proxy pointing at Robinhood's
  shared EIP-1967 beacon `0xe10b6f6b275de231345c20d14ab812db62151b00`, which a
  permissionless impersonator cannot forge. One batched JSON-RPC round-trip
  (`https://rpc.mainnet.chain.robinhood.com`, no key, ~0.5s) classifies each
  match as `verified`, `not-deployed`, `not-a-stock-token`, or `unverified`,
  and a top-level `warning` carries the caveat. Undeployed listings are still
  returned — silently dropping them reads as "the skill is broken" — but are
  flagged and never presented as usable addresses.

  Following `robinhood-chain-stocks`, an unreachable node yields `unverified`
  rather than a negative verdict: a network fault is never reported as evidence
  that a token is fake. `--no-verify` skips the check explicitly and says so in
  its own wording, and `--rpc-url` points at an alternate node. The name-suffix
  match is retained only as the offline fallback, now tolerant of truncation.

- TaskRuntime queue depth gauge (`agentos_queue_depth`) now decrements when
  tasks leave the pending queue, instead of staying stuck at the peak enqueue
  value (#668).
- The sensitive-path hard block now refuses destructive intents that target
  the filesystem root. `rm -rf /` carries no sensitive *prefix*, so the
  denylist never matched it and a whole-host wipe fell through to the ordinary
  approval flow — which `/elevated bypass` skips outright. Every spelling that
  resolves to or sweeps the top level is covered: `/`, `//`, `/.`, `/..`,
  `/*`, `/*/*`, `/**`, `/?*`, `/.*` and `/[a-z]*`. Globs that name a subset
  (`/tmp*`) are untouched, and root counts as sensitive only in the
  delete-intent scan — reading or listing `/` stays ordinary work (#563).
- The image tool now reports a redirect that carries no `Location` header
  instead of the confusing failure it caused downstream. `_fetch_image_url`
  follows redirects itself so every hop is re-validated against the SSRF guard;
  a 3xx with no `Location` closed the response and fell out of the loop, so the
  failure surfaced as httpx's generic `Failed to fetch image from URL: Redirect
  response '302 Found' for url ...` (or a `StreamClosed` from reading the body
  that had just been closed, depending on the httpx version) rather than the
  dead-end hop that actually broke. It now raises `Redirect response from <url>
  missing Location header`, naming the URL that returned it.
- Channel HTTP retries now cover every transient timeout, survive an
  HTTP-date `Retry-After`, and hand back an exhausted rate limit.
  `retry_request` caught `(ConnectError, ReadTimeout)`, but `ConnectTimeout`,
  `WriteTimeout` and `PoolTimeout` descend from `TimeoutException` — a sibling
  of `ConnectError` under `TransportError` — so a DNS, TLS-handshake, upload or
  connection-pool timeout on any Slack/Discord/Telegram/webhook call escaped
  the backoff and crashed the caller on the first stall; the clause is now
  `(ConnectError, TimeoutException)`. `Retry-After` was parsed with a bare
  `float()`, so the HTTP-date form RFC 7231 §7.1.3 permits turned a rate limit
  into a `ValueError` inside the retry loop: the header is now resolved as
  delay-seconds or HTTP-date, falls back to the computed backoff when it is
  unparseable, non-finite, negative or already past, and is clamped to 300s so
  a provider cannot park a send for hours. The 429 branch also gained the
  `attempt < max_retries` guard the 5xx branch already had, so an exhausted
  rate limit returns the response — status, headers and provider error body
  intact — instead of sleeping once more and raising a bare
  `RuntimeError("retry_request exhausted")` (#642, #599).
- The email channel can poll an IMAP folder whose name contains spaces.
  `imap_folder` was handed to `imaplib` verbatim, and `imaplib` does not quote
  mailbox arguments, so a folder such as `Sent Items` — ordinary on
  Exchange/Outlook — went on the wire as two tokens and every poll failed with
  an opaque `BAD [CLIENTBUG] Invalid syntax`. The name is now emitted as an
  RFC 3501 quoted-string, escaping `\` and `"`, and a name carrying a control
  character (a CR or LF would have ended the command line and run its tail as a
  second IMAP command) is refused at channel start instead of at poll time.
- `SubscriptionManager._message_subs` now removes empty sets on
  unsubscription and connection teardown, preventing a slow memory leak
  on long-running gateways (#609).
- An email reply no longer drops the thread root when the inbound message
  carries no `References` header. `_merge_references` read only `References`,
  so for the second message of a thread — where most mail clients send
  `In-Reply-To` alone — the parent id was discarded and the outgoing reply
  referenced only itself, breaking the conversation apart in Gmail, Outlook and
  Thunderbird. The chain now falls back to `In-Reply-To` when `References` is
  absent, per RFC 5322 3.6.4. Both threading headers are now read by one
  parser that drops comments and accepts ids with or without angle brackets,
  and `thread_key_for` shares it, so the thread cache key and the reference
  chain can no longer disagree about which message is the root (#620).
- The Environment view's path strip shortens Windows paths again. `shortPath`
  split on `/` only, so a gateway-reported `C:\Users\<name>\.agentos\.env` counted
  as a single segment and was rendered untrimmed, overflowing the header strip
  it was written to keep short. Backslashes are normalised before splitting, so
  Windows and mixed-separator paths trim to their last two segments like POSIX
  ones do.
- Provider content-moderation blocks are classified as `POLICY_REFUSAL` again
  instead of falling through to `BAD_REQUEST`/`UNKNOWN`. `_is_policy_refusal()`
  held only generic phrasing, so the wording providers actually emit went
  unmatched: Azure OpenAI's canonical *"triggering Azure OpenAI's content
  management policy"* does not contain the adjacent words "content policy", the
  OpenAI/Azure `content_filter` code and `finish_reason` matched nothing, and
  Gemini's "blocked by safety" is not "safety policy". Since a refusal and a
  malformed request map to different recovery actions, the misclassification
  sent real policy blocks down the wrong path. Added `content_filter`,
  `content filter`, `responsible_ai_policy`, `content management policy` and
  `blocked by safety` (#629).

- Cron schedules that restrict both day-of-month and day-of-week now follow the
  POSIX OR rule instead of ANDing the two fields. `0 0 1,15 * 5` means "the 1st,
  the 15th, or any Friday" — as it does in cron, croniter, and every scheduler
  users compare against — where AgentOS previously required a date to be both a
  1st/15th *and* a Friday, silently killing such schedules for virtually the
  whole month. `CronField` now records whether the field was written as a bare
  `*`, since expanding `*` to the full value set made it indistinguishable from
  an explicit `1-31`/`0-6` at match time and the rule applies only when neither
  day field is a wildcard. Schedules with a wildcard in either day field are
  unchanged. This also restores parity with the cron panel in the web UI, whose
  "next runs" preview (`frontend/src/views/cron/logic.ts`) has always applied
  the OR rule — so the times it showed disagreed with when the job actually
  fired. ([#660](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/660))
- `MemorySyncManager` retries a file whose indexing failed instead of losing it
  until the next edit. `_do_file_sync()` replaced `_mtimes` with the fresh scan
  *before* the index loop ran, so by the time `store.index_file()` raised, the
  failing path was already recorded as seen — the next watcher tick compared
  equal, the path never entered `changes`, and the retry its docstring promised
  never happened. A transient store error (SQLite lock, provider timeout) on
  `MEMORY.md` therefore left searches running against a stale or missing index
  for that file until it was modified again or the process restarted. Index
  failures now come back from `_do_file_sync()` alongside the existing delete
  failures and are re-enqueued into `_pending_changes`, keeping the manager
  dirty until a retry succeeds. The initial `start()` pass re-enqueues too,
  where `_mtimes` is empty and the watcher diff could never have recovered the
  path (#638).

- `OtlpTraceSink.flush()` is serialized by the `_flush_lock` it always
  declared but never acquired. Concurrent flushes — a `write()` batch trigger
  racing the periodic flush task — could post to the OTLP collector
  simultaneously, delivering spans out of order and, when a post failed,
  re-queueing the same events twice so they were duplicated in the queue. The
  lock is now held across the drain-post-requeue cycle, with an empty-queue
  fast path before it so the uncontended case stays allocation-free
  ([#672](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/672)).
- `agentos sessions export` derives its default filename through
  `_safe_archive_part` instead of only replacing `:`. A session id is
  gateway-supplied text, and every character outside `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]` — a `/`
  or a `..` segment among them — reached `Path()` untouched, so the export
  could be written outside the directory the command was run in. The shared
  helper also now strips leading and trailing dots, so an id that sanitizes to
  `..` can no longer name the parent directory
  ([#678](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/678)).
- HTTP chat errors name the provider that actually failed.
  `_provider_display_name` mapped only a handful of kinds, so Azure, Bailian,
  Mistral, Groq, SiliconFlow, AIHubMix, MiniMax, BytePlus, Bankr, vLLM,
  LM Studio and OVMS all surfaced as a generic "Provider" in the message the
  user reads.

### Security

- The strict SSRF fetch guard now enforces the cloud-metadata floor directly
  instead of inferring it from the private/link-local ranges. `ssrf.py` keeps a
  shared `_METADATA_ADDRESSES` set described as the non-negotiable floor, but
  only the permissive guard (`assert_not_metadata_endpoint`, used by
  `http_request`) consulted it. The stricter `assert_address_allowed_for_fetch`
  — used by `web_fetch`, the media image fetch, browser navigation and
  skill-dependency downloads — derived its coverage from `is_private` /
  `is_loopback` / `is_link_local` / `is_reserved` instead.

  That left the two guards inverted for one address. Alibaba Cloud's
  `100.100.100.200` sits in CGNAT space (`100.64.0.0/10`), which Python
  classifies as none of those and which no hard-blocked network covers, so the
  *strict* guard allowed it while the *permissive* one blocked it. On an
  Alibaba ECS deployment a URL the agent could be steered to fetch — directly,
  or by prompt injection from page content it reads — returned the instance RAM
  role credentials into the transcript. The connect-time guard shares the same
  predicate, so DNS-delivered and redirect-hop variants were equally unguarded.

  The metadata hostname check (`metadata.google.internal` and friends) now runs
  in `validate_http_url_for_fetch` too, so a resolver answering those names
  cannot launder the request through a public-looking address. Fetch policy is
  a strict superset of the metadata-only policy again, and a parametrized test
  asserts that for every entry in the shared set — the invariant that was
  missing, rather than the single address that happened to break it.

- The MCP SSE and Streamable HTTP transports now connect through the same
  SSRF guard as the built-in HTTP tools. Both built a bare `httpx.AsyncClient`
  from `MCPServerConfig.url` with no validation at all, so an MCP server entry
  pointed at `169.254.169.254` reached the cloud metadata endpoint and its
  instance credentials.

  The policy is `validate_metadata_only_address` — the floor `http_request`
  takes — not the full `validate_http_url_for_fetch`: `http://localhost:PORT/mcp`
  and LAN-hosted MCP servers are the normal, intended configuration, and the
  stricter policy rejects loopback and private ranges. The guard is installed as
  a connect-time network backend (`ssrf_guarded_client`) rather than run once
  against the URL text, so the address that gets validated is the address that
  gets dialed: checking the URL and then handing it to a plain client leaves
  httpx to resolve the hostname a second time, which a short-TTL DNS-rebinding
  name can answer differently. Non-`http(s)` server URLs are now rejected up
  front. ([#662](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/662))

- Slack webhooks are rejected when no signing secret is configured, instead of
  being ingested. `_handle_webhook` logged a warning and carried on:
  `event_callback` payloads were ingested and slash commands were enqueued, so
  any unauthenticated POST to the Events API endpoint could inject messages and
  commands into a session — only interactive form payloads were turned away.
  The handler now fails closed. Without a signing secret it still answers the
  `url_verification` handshake — that only echoes a challenge and has no side
  effects, so an operator can pass Slack's endpoint check while wiring the
  secret up — and returns 401 for everything else
  ([#674](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/674)).
- Slack request signatures are verified against the raw request bytes. The
  base string was assembled as text (`f"v0:{timestamp}:{body.decode()}"`) and
  re-encoded, so any body whose bytes do not survive a UTF-8 decode/encode
  round-trip — and any body that fails to decode at all, which raises inside
  the verifier — was checked against a different byte sequence than the one
  Slack signed. The HMAC is now computed over `b"v0:" + timestamp + b":" +
  body` with the body never decoded
  ([#680](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/680)).

## [2026.9.2] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- **Surplus Intelligence** (`surplus`) as a runtime provider — a two-sided
  marketplace that routes each request to the cheapest healthy seller. It is
  configured like any other OpenAI-compatible provider with a buyer API key
  (`SURPLUS_API_KEY`, `inf_…`) against
  `https://api.surplusintelligence.ai/v1`; the x402/USDC and MPP per-request
  payment protocols it also offers are deliberately not wired up, so nothing
  crypto-related enters the dependency tree.

  Its model catalog is public and unauthenticated, and follows OpenRouter's
  shape rather than the flatter gateway one — rates are USD *per token*, and an
  extra `supported_features` array names `vision`/`reasoning`/`tools` directly.
  Because marketplace prices move with seller competition, cost estimates come
  from that live catalog instead of a static table: the boot fetch doubles as
  the price seed and refreshes on its own TTL, with a bounded negative cache
  when it is unreachable. `AGENTOS_SURPLUS_LIVE_PRICING=0` pins estimates to
  the static table.

  Ships a `surplus` router tier profile (`deepseek-v4-flash`, `gpt-5.6-luna`,
  `glm-5.3`, `claude-opus-5`, image `glm-5.3-flash`). Without one the router
  would silently fall back to the OpenRouter tier table, whose namespaced ids
  (`openai/gpt-5.6-luna`) this marketplace does not serve. The image tier is
  `glm-5.3-flash` rather than OpenCAP's `minimax-m3`: Surplus publishes
  `minimax-m3` without vision.

- Two GMGN wallet skills the earlier vendoring pass left behind:
  `gmgn-wallet-analysis` (a copy-trade dossier on one wallet — four pass/fail
  gates, what it holds and buys now, its copy window in seconds, and a size cap)
  and `gmgn-wallet-score` (track record, copy-tradeability with a
  latency/slippage/gas backtest, and developer reputation for wallets that
  mostly launch tokens). Both answer "should I follow this trader", which the
  bundled set could previously only support with raw `gmgn-portfolio` fields.
  Upstream's `gmgn-wallet-score` frontmatter is not valid YAML — an unquoted
  `: ` inside `description` — so its description is folded into a block scalar
  here; without that the loader drops the skill silently.
- New bundled skill `robinhood-chain-stocks`: reads tokenized-stock state
  directly from Robinhood Chain (chainId 4663) over JSON-RPC — Chainlink USD
  price, the ERC-8056 `uiMultiplier()` corporate-action ratio, `oraclePaused()`,
  total supply, and wallet balances with their USD value. Read-only by
  construction: it issues only `eth_call` and never signs, sends, or holds a
  key. Feed addresses are resolved from Chainlink's reference-data directory
  rather than hardcoded, resolved from the ticker the contract reports so an
  address-only lookup still finds its price. Prices carry `ageSeconds` and a
  `stale` flag (past the feed's heartbeat, or oracle paused) so a market-closed
  quote is not read as the current price, and a non-positive feed answer is
  reported as unusable instead of `$0`. Authenticity is reported three ways —
  verified, disproven by a revert, or unverified because the node was
  unreachable — so a network fault is never presented as proof that a genuine
  listing is fake.

- `agentos cost savings` reports what the Pilot Router actually saved. Every
  turn already wrote `SavingsTelemetry` to `~/.agentos/logs/decisions-*.jsonl`
  and nothing read it back; the existing reports covered routing quality and
  feature-extraction latency, not dollars. The command rolls that telemetry up
  into a summary and a per-route breakdown with `--json`, `--csv`,
  `--start-date` / `--end-date`, `--log-dir`, and `--pdf` for a branded
  one-page report. It reads the decision log directly, so it works with the
  gateway stopped.

  The figure is a floor, and the report says so on the page. Despite its name,
  `routing_savings_usd_estimated_vs_baseline` is not measured against the
  sibling `baseline_model` field: it is the input-price delta between the
  routed model and the most expensive model configured in `[router.tiers]`,
  times input tokens, clamped at zero. So the column is labelled `Requested`,
  the comparison is named as the top tier, and only input tokens are priced —
  tool-result projection, short-reply enforcement, prompt-cache hits and
  thinking mode are all excluded so the number stays attributable to the
  router (#788).

### Changed

- The default skills-prompt budget (`skills.max_skills_prompt_chars`) rises from
  24,000 to 26,000 characters. The shipped skill set's own descriptions had grown
  past the old ceiling, which would have dropped full-mode installs to a
  narrower render; the budget is a cap, so installs that were already under it
  send no more than before. Configs that set the value themselves are untouched.
- OpenCAP's router tier defaults track OpenCAP's own catalog again. `c2` moves
  from `glm-5.2` to `glm-5.3` (1.31M context, published by the gateway since the
  last update), and the profile is declared in its own table instead of being
  cloned from the Bankr profile with the provider string swapped — the two
  gateways publish overlapping but different catalogs, so cloning made OpenCAP
  silently inherit Bankr's release cadence. `c0` (`deepseek-v4-flash`), `c1`
  (`gpt-5.6-luna`), `c3` (`claude-opus-5`) and the image route (`minimax-m3`)
  are unchanged; each is still the newest of its family the gateway serves.
- Five models OpenCAP now publishes are declared in the model registry:
  `glm-5.3`, `glm-5.3-flash`, `grok-4.6`, `kimi-k3` and `muse-spark-1.2`. They
  carry published context windows, output caps and vendor rack rates, so an
  offline estimate for them no longer falls through to the generic $3/$15
  default. OpenCAP's live catalog remains canonical for its own pricing.
- The Ollama "model not found" branch of `classify_provider_error` now spells
  out its grouping as `"model not found" in text or ("pull" in text and "model"
  in text)`. The behaviour is unchanged — `and` already bound tighter than `or`
  — but the intent no longer rests on implicit precedence, and the branch is
  now covered by tests (#582).

### Fixed

- The email channel no longer honours an off-allowlist `Reply-To`. The From
  address was checked against the fail-closed `allowed_senders` list, but the
  `Reply-To` header — equally attacker-controlled on an admitted message — was
  taken verbatim as the reply target, so an allowlisted sender could redirect
  the agent's answer, tool output included, to any mailbox. `Reply-To` is now
  run through the same allowlist and falls back to the From address when it is
  off-list, rather than the whole message being rejected. The reply target is
  re-checked when the outbound reply is built, so a stale or tampered thread
  cache cannot reintroduce an off-list recipient.
- A `thinking_level` set on an OpenCAP GLM tier is no longer silently dropped.
  The gateway capability gate reported `supports_reasoning=False` for every
  model except DeepSeek V4, so the `c2` default's declared `thinking_level`
  never reached the wire even though GLM 5.x reasons by default and streams
  `reasoning_content`. GLM ids on OpenCAP now resolve Z.ai's
  `{"thinking": {"type": ...}}` switch, verified live in both positions. Scoped
  to OpenCAP; the Bankr gateway is a separate deployment and keeps its previous
  behavior.
- The offline vision fallback recognizes `gpt-5.6-*`, `glm-5.3-flash` and
  `muse-spark-*` as image-capable. Previously, if the catalog fetch failed, the
  `c1` default was reported as text-only and image turns had nowhere to route.
- `upsert_llm_provider` now validates an operator-supplied provider `base_url`
  before it is persisted or handed to the httpx client. The RPC
  (`onboarding.provider.configure`) and `agentos providers configure` accepted
  any string, so a caller could point every completion request — carrying the
  provider `Authorization` header — at a cloud metadata service, an internal
  host, or an attacker's server, or hand a `file://` URL to httpx. The value
  must now be an absolute http(s) URL and may not be a cloud metadata endpoint
  or a private / link-local / reserved IP — including the `inet_aton` spellings
  (`http://2852039166/`) that reach the metadata service without looking like
  an address. Loopback stays allowed for local model servers, and a `base_url`
  that is already persisted (a saved profile, a provider default, or the value
  the onboarding import path replays) is not re-validated (#551).

- `robinhood-rwa-addresses` no longer answers a company question with a
  community token that impersonates it. Robinhood Chain is permissionless and
  the public token list carries both kinds: two entries are named "GameStop"
  with symbol `GME`, and the lookup stripped the `• Robinhood Token` suffix —
  the only thing telling them apart — before ranking, so which address came
  back was down to list order. Asking for `NET` returned the "NetNet" community
  token above Cloudflare. The lookup now matches Stock Tokens only (opt back in
  with `--include-community`, where real listings still rank first), tags every
  match with `isStockToken`, and reports a `stock_tokens` count. The skill doc's
  hardcoded "~228 tokens" claim, stale against the 658-entry list, is gone
  (#745).
- Email channel outbound sends no longer fail for every agent-initiated
  message. `EmailChannel._resolve_target` read only `metadata["to"]` and the
  in-memory inbound-thread table, so the built-in `message` tool (which writes
  the target as `metadata["recipient"]`) and scheduler / heartbeat delivery
  (which pass the bare address as `reply_to`) both raised
  `ValueError: email.send has no recipient for reply_to`. Recipients now
  resolve in order: `metadata["to"]`, `metadata["recipient"]`, the thread
  cache, then `reply_to` when it parses as an address; a fresh outbound mail
  with no thread also gets a real subject instead of `Re: (no subject)` (#598).
- **Security (SSRF, DNS rebinding):** the SSRF guard validated a URL by
  resolving its hostname once, but httpx resolved that hostname *again* when it
  opened the connection — so a short-TTL (rebinding) domain could answer with a
  public address for the guard and with `169.254.169.254` for the socket,
  handing an agent the cloud metadata endpoint and the instance credentials it
  serves. `agentos.tools.ssrf_client` adds a validating httpcore network backend
  that resolves and checks the destination itself at connect time and then
  connects to a validated IP literal, so the address that was checked is the
  address that is used; TLS is unchanged (SNI and certificate verification still
  run against the origin hostname). `web_fetch`, the media image fetch,
  `http_request` and `x_search` (metadata-endpoint floor only, so localhost and
  LAN targets keep working) and skill-dependency downloads all fetch through it
  (#516).
- Gemini context-overflow errors classify as `CONTEXT_OVERFLOW` again. Gemini
  reports overflow as `the input token count (X) exceeds the maximum number of
  tokens allowed (Y)`, which no marker matched, so it fell through to the
  `status_code == 400` branch and surfaced as `BAD_REQUEST` — the turn died
  instead of taking the `COMPACT_AND_RETRY` path (#657).
- Anthropic context-overflow errors do the same. `prompt_too_long`,
  `exceed context limit`, `request_too_large` and `request size exceeds` join
  the marker list, so an overflowed Anthropic turn compacts and retries rather
  than surfacing a bad-request error to the user (#613).
- The `@sandboxed` decorator derives a valid argv for `git_diff`. The
  `argv_factory` produced a command line the sandbox could not run, so the
  tool failed under sandboxing rather than being inspected and allowed (#614).
- `web_fetch` decodes the body with the charset the server advertised
  (`Content-Type`'s `charset` parameter) instead of a hard-coded UTF-8 decode,
  so ISO-8859-1, Shift_JIS and GBK pages no longer reach the model as runs of
  U+FFFD. The encoding is snapshotted inside the client block before any body
  read, matching what `http_request` already does.
- `MemorySyncManager` passes the filesystem mtime its watcher already captured
  to `LongTermMemoryStore.index_file()`, for both watched memory files and
  knowledge-base documents. Persisted freshness and retrieval recency now
  track the source file rather than the moment the sync ran, matching the
  direct ingestion path — and without an extra stat (#649).
- The scheduler cancels its startup catch-up tasks on shutdown. They were
  fired and never retained, so a shutdown mid-catch-up left them running
  against a closing runtime instead of being cancelled and awaited with the
  regular timer tasks (#655).

### Security

- `GET /api/approvals` is no longer exempt from per-IP rate limiting. The
  endpoint serializes every pending exec/plugin approval — command, argv and
  params — and takes a SQLite read on each call, so the carve-out let any
  caller that clears the auth gate poll it at unlimited rate: continuous
  observation of pending tool-call arguments, and enough SQLite read pressure
  to stall the approval/chat pipeline. On the default `auth.mode="none"`
  (loopback-confined) that is any local process; under token auth it is any
  token holder. `HEAD` is covered too — Starlette serves it from the same
  route, so it runs the same handler.

  It is now counted in a dedicated per-IP bucket rather than the shared
  `/api/*` one, because the Web UI polls it every 1.5s (~40 req/min per open
  tab) and the shared default of 100/min would have 429'd operators out of
  their own approval queue. The cap is `AGENTOS_RATE_APPROVALS_MAX_REQUESTS`,
  default 300 per window. Being per-IP, it bounds a single source; it is not a
  defence against a distributed one (#569).
- Proxy names are no longer writable through any AgentOS surface. `set_env_var`
  (and the Web UI, `agentos env set`, and the gateway RPC) could previously
  write `AGENTOS_LLM_PROXY`, which `gateway/llm_runtime.py`, `provider/openai.py`
  and `provider/auxiliary.py` apply to every provider client — letting an agent,
  or a prompt injection reaching one, route all model traffic through a proxy of
  its choosing and read the `Authorization` header off it. `AGENTOS_LLM_PROXY`,
  `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` now join
  `env_policy.WRITE_DENYLIST`, matched in **any casing** — the proxy readers
  (`urllib.request.getproxies_environment()`, which httpx goes through)
  lower-case every name they find, so denying only the two conventional
  spellings would leave `Http_Proxy` as an equivalent way in. `AGENTOS_TRUST_ENV`,
  which decides whether the ambient `*_PROXY` names are honoured at all, is
  denied with the other posture names. Values exported in the shell or
  hand-written into `~/.agentos/.env` keep working; only writing through
  AgentOS is refused (#550).
- **Trusted-proxy auth validates the transport peer, not a header substring.**
  `auth.mode = "trusted-proxy"` admitted any request whose client-supplied
  `X-Forwarded-For` merely *contained* the configured proxy string — the real
  peer was never checked, so any network peer could send
  `X-Forwarded-For: <proxy>` and get full Control RPC access. The gate now
  requires `request.client.host` to be in the trusted-proxy set; once that
  passes, `XFF` is honoured downstream for client identity, which is what the
  mode exists for (nginx / Caddy / ALB all set it). The trust check is a single
  shared `peer_is_trusted_proxy` helper used by `AuthMiddleware`,
  `RateLimitMiddleware` and the RPC `resolve_auth` layer — which previously had
  no trusted-proxy branch at all — so the two gates cannot drift (#568).
- **Cron webhooks cannot reach cloud metadata endpoints.**
  `validate_webhook_url` checked only scheme and hostname, so a cron job could
  POST its run output — model output and tool results — to AWS IMDS, the GCP or
  Azure metadata service, or anything else in the link-local range, and the
  response would come back as the delivery result. The shared metadata floor
  `http_request` already uses is now applied on create, on update, and at
  delivery time. Localhost hooks keep working (#574).
- **`web_fetch` downloads are capped at a hard byte limit.** The whole response
  body was buffered into memory before `max_chars` was applied — `max_chars`
  truncates what the model sees, not what is downloaded — so one chunked
  response with no (or a lying) `content-length` could exhaust process memory
  and take the agent or gateway down; the 30s timeout bounds time, not bytes.
  The response is now streamed and reading stops at
  `AGENTOS_WEB_FETCH_DOWNLOAD_LIMIT` (default 1 MiB), with `truncated=True`
  when the cap is hit. The response is closed only after the redirect
  `Location` header is read, so a 3xx with no `Location` no longer fails
  against a closed stream (#502).
- **The exec approval cache parses every `rm` in a compound command.** It used
  `re.search`, which stops at the first match, so `rm A; rm -rf /` had its
  second invocation skipped entirely — the destructive target never reached the
  intent scan. Every `rm` is now tokenized independently with `re.finditer`,
  with capture stopping at shell separators. Regression tests pin both layers:
  every separator ends an `rm` invocation, and a sensitive *read* in a later
  segment is still refused at the tool boundary by `exec_command`'s
  whole-command scan (#512, #676).

## [2026.9.1] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Observability for long-running gateways: a Prometheus `GET /metrics` endpoint
  backed by thread-safe multi-dimensional `Counter` / `Gauge` / `Histogram`
  types wired to `TaskRuntime`, an `OtlpTraceSink` that exports `TraceEvent`
  records to any OpenTelemetry collector over HTTP/JSON (`/v1/traces`), and a
  log-retention sweeper that prunes `~/.agentos/logs/**` by TTL age and by a
  maximum total disk budget so a gateway left running for months no longer
  fills the disk (#367).

### Changed

- Project knowledge is now capped at 24,000 characters on write — the same
  ceiling the per-turn injection applies — instead of 32,000. Text between the
  two caps used to save fine, echo back intact from the API, and then be
  silently truncated out of every turn with only the model able to see the
  marker. Rows already above the new cap keep working (validated on the next
  write, truncated at injection until then), and the Web UI knowledge editor
  now shows a character counter for the real limit.

### Security

- The `projects_*` agent tools are now scoped to the calling session.
  `projects_list` used to hand the model every project's knowledge text and
  `projects_update` accepted any `project_id`, so one prompt-injected
  instruction in any member session could read all knowledge and overwrite
  another project's — text that then runs inside the system prompt of every
  member session of that project, every turn. `projects_move_session` likewise
  accepted arbitrary session keys, allowing the same hand-off by moving a
  victim session into a poisoned project. Now `projects_update` edits only the
  calling session's own project, `projects_list` includes knowledge only for
  that project, and `projects_move_session` moves only the calling session;
  cross-project management stays on the Web UI / CLI / RPC surface, which is
  control-plane only.
- Gateway token authentication now compares secrets in constant time. The four
  token gates (`resolve_auth` for WebSocket/RPC, the HTTP `AuthMiddleware`, the
  upload route and the audio-transcription route) used `==`/`!=`, which
  short-circuits on the first differing byte and leaks the token byte by byte
  under timing analysis. All four route through a shared `token_matches` helper
  built on `hmac.compare_digest` that fails closed on a missing or empty
  configured token; the auth contract is otherwise unchanged (#498).
- The sensitive-payload egress guard now inspects URL userinfo. It scanned path
  segments and query values only, but httpx turns `https://user:sk-…@host/` into
  an `Authorization: Basic` header on the wire, so a vendor-shaped credential
  parked in userinfo egressed unchecked through `http_request`, `web_fetch`
  (on every redirect hop) and the media `image` tool. Username and password are
  now percent-decoded and matched, raising a `sensitive_url_userinfo` marker
  (#499).
- `http_request` now caps what it downloads, not just what it returns. The
  request was issued non-streaming, so httpx buffered the whole body into
  memory before the 1 MB model-facing limit was applied — a chunked response
  with no (or a lying) `content-length` read fully into RAM, letting one
  attacker-influenced URL exhaust process memory. The response is now streamed
  and accumulation stops at a hard byte ceiling, reporting `download_capped`
  (#508).
- Scheduler `timeout_seconds` is bounded on both cron create and update.
  It was accepted unvalidated: `<= 0` makes `asyncio.wait_for` run the handler
  with no wait at all, and a huge value holds a model turn open for years — a
  scheduler denial of service from a single `add`/`update` call. Values below
  1 second or above 24 hours are now rejected (#570).

### Fixed

- `robinhood-rwa-addresses` no longer answers a company question with a
  community token that impersonates it. Robinhood Chain is permissionless and
  the public token list carries both kinds: two entries are named "GameStop"
  with symbol `GME`, and the lookup stripped the `• Robinhood Token` suffix —
  the only thing telling them apart — before ranking, so which address came
  back was down to list order. Asking for `NET` returned the "NetNet" community
  token above Cloudflare. The lookup now matches Stock Tokens only (opt back in
  with `--include-community`, where real listings still rank first), tags every
  match with `isStockToken`, and reports a `stock_tokens` count. The skill doc's
  hardcoded "~228 tokens" claim, stale against the 658-entry list, is gone.

- Two clients editing the same project no longer overwrite each other.
  `projects.update` used to read the whole row, apply the change, and write
  every column back, so a rename holding a stale row silently reverted a
  concurrent knowledge save. Updates now write only the fields passed, and the
  Web UI sends the `updatedAt` it last read so a lost race returns a
  `project.conflict` error (draft kept, latest version loaded) instead of
  clobbering. Same-millisecond writes get distinct `updated_at` values, and a
  unique index on project names (V012) backstops the duplicate-name check
  under concurrent creates.
- The Projects page now listens to the gateway's `projects.changed` /
  `sessions.changed` broadcasts, so another client's create, rename, delete,
  or session move shows up without pressing Refresh. Moving a session between
  projects via `sessions.patch` also broadcasts `projects.changed`, keeping
  other clients' session counts fresh, and the move can no longer be reverted
  by a simultaneous field patch on storage-only session managers.
- The Projects page no longer renders its loading and error states as the
  "No projects yet" empty state (with a create button) — loads show a spinner
  and failures show the error with a Retry action. Browser back/forward can no
  longer leak one project's unsaved draft into another project's editor, and
  a saved knowledge edit no longer flashes the stale pre-save text.

- Router metadata no longer reports a model the provider never ran. An explicit
  model — a durable `config.agents[].model`, a session pin, or a per-call
  override — beats the Pilot Router's pick when `PromptAssemblerStage` resolves
  the final model, but the metadata kept advertising the route as applied, so
  the Web UI router HUD, the `DoneEvent`, per-turn usage and the savings figures
  all named the routed model and credited savings for a route the turn never
  took. The decision is now demoted the same way the `observe` rollout phase
  already does it (`routing_applied=false`, tier and model kept on the record as
  advice), and per-turn savings are priced from the model that actually ran —
  which also corrects the cost basis reported during `observe` (#586).
- Two provider failures that made whole model families unusable. Requests to
  the `opencap` and `bankr` provider kinds now carry the required `x-api-key`
  header on chat completions and model listing, instead of failing with
  `HTTP 401: API key required for remote API access`. And Gemini reasoning
  models no longer reject tool calls with `HTTP 400: Function call is missing a
  thought_signature`: the signature is captured from streamed and non-streamed
  deltas, carried on `ToolUseEndEvent` / `ContentBlockToolUse` / `ToolCall`
  through the turn loop, session sanitization and history deserialization, and
  echoed back when messages are rebuilt (#519).
- `agentos upgrade` no longer leaves orphaned processes on Windows. On a
  timeout, `_kill_process_group()` called `proc.kill()`, which terminates only
  the direct child — grandchildren (compilers, downloads, nested Python runs)
  survived and kept file locks on the virtualenv. Windows now uses
  `taskkill /T /F /PID` to kill the whole tree, falling back to `proc.kill()`
  only if that fails; POSIX still uses `os.killpg` SIGTERM→SIGKILL (#536).

## [2026.8.29] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- Memory Web UI view and knowledge-base document ingestion. The console gets a
  browsable `/memory` view (sidebar entry, `g m` chord) with a curated-memory
  editor, a knowledge-base document table, a raw source-file explorer and a
  semantic search explorer. Behind it, `memory.ingest` grows multi-format text
  extraction and directory ingestion (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, Markdown, text, CSV,
  JSON/YAML and code files) over `<workspace>/knowledge_base/`, exposed as
  `memory.curated.*` and `memory.knowledge_base.*` JSON-RPC methods and as
  `agentos memory ingest` / `agentos memory curated` on the CLI (#368).

- Email channel (`type = "email"`). A mailbox is now a first-class channel:
  inbound over IMAP polling, outbound over SMTP with `In-Reply-To`/`References`
  so replies stay in the originating thread. No platform app registration —
  just IMAP/SMTP credentials. One mail thread is one session, quoted history is
  stripped before the text reaches the model, HTML-only mail is flattened to
  text, and inbound attachments plus generated artifacts ride the shared
  attachment pipeline under the usual size limits. Access is a required
  fail-closed `allowed_senders` From-address allowlist (exact addresses or
  `*@domain` patterns); mail from the agent's own address and anything marked
  auto-generated (`Auto-Submitted`, `X-Autoreply`, `List-Id`,
  `Precedence: bulk`) is dropped so an autoresponder cannot start a mail loop
  (#369).

### Changed

- Channel session keys: a DM-shaped channel whose surface is itself threaded
  can opt into one session per thread with `metadata['dm_thread_scoped']`.
  Adapters that do not set it keep one session per peer, so Slack, Discord and
  Telegram DM keys are unchanged.

### Fixed

- Security: the git tools (`git_status`, `git_diff`, `git_log`, `git_commit`)
  now mask credentials in their output before it reaches the model. `git_diff`
  returns working-tree and staged file content verbatim, so a `.env` that was
  committed once kept reaching the model in cleartext on every diff, while the
  sibling file surfaces (`read_file`, `grep_search`) already redacted. Masking
  happens at the one `_run_git` chokepoint, on the sandboxed and subprocess
  paths and on success and failure alike. The assignment pass runs
  unconditionally (`code_file=False`) because a diff is arbitrary repository
  content and the git argv says nothing about what is coming back, and the
  non-reusable `«redacted:…»` sentinel is used because an agent may pipe a diff
  straight back through `git apply`.
- Security: a named credential on a diff line no longer escapes the assignment
  redaction pass. The token-start anchor did not admit the diff marker, so
  `+MY_SECRET=…` went unmasked where `MY_SECRET=…` was masked; vendor-prefixed
  keys were still caught by the shape pass, non-vendor named secrets were not.
  The anchor now accepts one or two marker columns, covering the combined diff
  a conflicted merge produces as well as the ordinary unified form.
- Slack sends and scheduler webhook deliveries now survive a transient network
  blip. Both routed their HTTP calls straight at `httpx` and failed on the
  first error; they now go through the same `retry_request` helper Discord
  already uses (exponential backoff with jitter on 429 — honouring
  `Retry-After` — 500/502/503/504, connect errors, and read timeouts). Fatal
  statuses such as 400/401 still fail on the first attempt, and the webhook
  retry keeps the stock 3-retry/1s-base budget so its worst case stays inside
  the cron job's own timeout. Note that retrying a read timeout on
  `chat.postMessage` or a webhook POST can duplicate a delivery the receiver
  already accepted — the same trade-off Discord has always made; the webhook
  payload's `jobId` is the receiver's dedupe key.

- Security: `execute_code` output is redacted before it reaches the model.
  `shell.py` already ran `redact_terminal_output` on every output surface, but
  `execute_code` bypassed redaction entirely, so a script printing `os.environ`
  or reading a credential file leaked every secret verbatim into the
  transcript. Redaction now happens at `_execution_result_json`, the single
  choke point for all eight return paths (#490).
- Security: the `image` tool no longer buffers an unbounded response body
  before checking its size limit. `_fetch_image_url` read `resp.content` in
  full and only then compared against the 20 MB ceiling, so an oversized or
  chunked body could exhaust process memory. The response is now streamed and
  the read stops the moment the accumulated size passes the limit; each
  redirect hop is still SSRF-checked before its body is read (#506).
- Security: the GitHub skill-hub source caps blob downloads. `GitHubSource.fetch()`
  buffered every blob of a skill directory with a non-streaming `client.get`,
  with no per-blob cap and no total budget, so a hostile repo could push the
  installer into RAM exhaustion. Blobs are now streamed against a per-blob
  ceiling (8 MiB) and a cumulative budget (32 MiB), the response is closed in a
  `finally`, and a blob over the cap fails closed rather than installing a
  truncated bundle (#510).
- Scheduler: one-shot `AT` schedules in the past are rejected by
  `SchedulerOps.add()` and `update()` (5s skew tolerance) instead of being
  stored with a stale `next_run_at` that fires on the very next tick (#486).
- Scheduler: `next_due_at` now reports the actual runnable time,
  `MIN(MAX(next_run_at, backoff_until))`. It previously looked only at
  `next_run_at` while `iter_due` also waits on `backoff_until`, so after a few
  failures on a frequent cron the timer woke early, yielded nothing and
  busy-spun SQLite for the whole backoff window (#537).
- MCP stdio: the live reader uses `readexactly` instead of `read(n)`, which
  could return a short buffer and truncate a chunked tool result into a
  `json.loads` failure; EOF now raises a clear truncated-body error (#537).
- Telegram: entity offsets are sliced on the UTF-16 grid. Offsets and lengths
  are UTF-16 code units but were applied to a Python `str` by code point, so an
  emoji before `/help@mybot` in a group made the bot ignore a command aimed at
  it (#537).
- Provider failover: an exhausted fallback chain raises the explicit
  `IndexError("No more provider fallbacks available")`.
  `next_fallback_after_failure()` advanced the chain index unbounded and
  surfaced a bare out-of-range `IndexError` from `_build_provider` (#488).
- Discord: `_dispatch_loop` keeps dispatching after a reconnect. Opcode 7/9 and
  a dropped socket reconnected and then returned from the loop — heartbeat
  resumed and health still read connected, but messages and slash commands were
  never read again (#538).
- Setup: cancelling xAI sign-in stops the poll loop. Cancel only reset the
  visible card, so an expiry could paint an error after dismissal and a
  restarted sign-in could be wiped by the old loop completing; cancel and start
  now bump a generation counter (#538).
- Workspace paths: a real nested `workspace/` folder inside the configured root
  is no longer stripped. Any absolute path containing a `workspace` segment was
  rewritten from the last such segment, so reads and writes landed on a sibling
  file; paths already inside the root are left alone and sandbox
  `/workspace/...` still remaps (#538).
- Web UI: the projects page header stacks on mobile instead of overflowing.

## [2026.8.28] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Projects. Chat sessions can now be grouped into projects — cross-agent, so
  sessions of any agent can join the same project (a project's agent field is
  only the default for "new chat in project") — each carrying a free-form
  **knowledge** text that is injected into the system prompt of every member
  session (as an untrusted-wrapped `Project Knowledge`
  block, re-read each turn so edits land on the next turn). Surfaces: a new
  Projects page in the Web UI (create/rename/edit knowledge/delete, "New chat
  in project", session list per project), project badge + filter + "Move to
  project" on the Sessions page, project tiers in the chat session switcher,
  an `agentos projects` CLI group (`list`/`create`/`show`/`update`/`delete`/
  `move`), `projects.*` JSON-RPC methods plus `projectId` on
  `sessions.create`/`sessions.patch`/`sessions.list`, and agent-facing
  `projects_*` tools with `session_search scope=project` for searching sibling
  transcripts. Existing databases migrate automatically (V011); old sessions
  come up project-less, and deleting a project detaches its sessions instead
  of deleting them.

### Fixed

- Cron: day-of-week `7` is Sunday again, so `0 0 * * 7` schedules Sundays
  instead of being rejected (#478).
- Cron: a reversed range in a stepped field (`30-20/5`) is refused up front
  with a clear error instead of parsing into surprise fire times (#480).
- Cron: month and day-of-week names are case-insensitive — `jan`, `JAN` and
  `Jan` are the same month, `sun`/`SUN` the same day (#482).
- Scheduler: the timezone alias on a legacy expression schedule is honored
  instead of silently falling back (#485).

## [2026.8.27] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Spend budgets. A new `[budgets]` config section sets money ceilings per
  session, per UTC day, per agent, and per channel. A turn that starts at or
  above a hard limit is refused before any provider call with a
  `budget_exceeded` error naming the scope and the number; a matching
  `*_warn` threshold raises a one-shot `budget_warning` without stopping the
  turn. Ceilings are re-checked between iterations within a turn as well, so a
  single turn with a long tool loop cannot run past one. Spend is persisted to
  `~/.agentos/state/spend_ledger.db`, so a ceiling survives a gateway restart —
  a runaway overnight loop cannot be reset by a crash-and-respawn. Nothing is
  enforced until an operator sets a number.

- `aero-stock-lp` joins the Bankr skill hub. The skill range-LPs Coinbase
  tokenized equities (NVDA, AAPL, GOOGL, META) and AERO/USDC on Aerodrome
  Slipstream (Base) — opening, recentering, and exiting concentrated-liquidity
  positions, reporting pool status, NAV, yields, and P&L, and routing each
  position to whichever side pays more at this epoch, staked for AERO emissions
  or unstaked for trading fees. It is published as a directory in
  `BankrBot/skills`, so it browses and installs through the existing repo half
  of the Bankr source with no new code path.

### Removed

- Three subsystems that shipped in the wheel while being dead or
  permanently-failing are gone (#362). The `onboard_agent` wizard — the
  `wizard.start` / `wizard.next` / `wizard.cancel` / `wizard.status` RPC
  methods plus their state machine — had no caller in the frontend or the CLI
  and no side effect: its terminal step returned the collected answers and
  never created an agent, while its hardcoded model list had gone two
  generations stale. The Agents view already creates agents through
  `agents.create`. The `canvas` and `nodes` built-in tools validated their
  `action` argument and then raised `ToolError` unconditionally; no node
  runtime exists anywhere in the tree to configure, and only
  `exposed_by_default=False` kept them from failing in front of a model.
  `tools/visibility.py` no longer exports `filter_by_profile` (returned its
  input) or `profile_allows_tool` (returned `True`), nor does the dispatch
  chain run the `ProfilePolicy` that only called them — profile enforcement
  now has one home in `tools/policy_config.py`. `ToolProfile` and
  `resolve_profile` stay; they are the live seam.

- The `agentos dist` install inventory no longer advertises built-in tools that
  are not in the wheel. `bundled_tools` listed `nodes` (deleted above) and
  `agent` (no such module for some time), so an inventory diff across releases
  showed capability that was not there. A new parity test asserts every name in
  `BUNDLED_TOOLS` resolves to a module under `agentos.tools.builtin`.

### Changed

- `UsageTracker.check_warning()` is removed. It had no callers; the
  `[budgets]` session ceilings replace it with a configurable, enforced
  equivalent.

- The Bankr user-skill allowlist — the half that carries skills published from
  a wallet on bankr.bot — is now empty. `stock-premium-lp-manager` was retired
  from it in favour of `aero-stock-lp`, which covers the same tokenized-equity
  LP workflow from the repository. Copies already installed keep working; the
  slug is no longer offered for browse or install.

### Fixed

- `agentos chat`, `agentos sessions`, `agentos skills`, and `agentos env` now
  send the resolved gateway token when they open their own WebSocket
  connection, and honour `AGENTOS_GATEWAY_URL` consistently. `resolve_auth`
  grants no loopback exemption in token mode, so setting `auth.mode = "token"`
  previously broke all four commands even on a purely local install — the
  token resolver existed (`default_gateway_token`) but these call sites never
  used it. `chat` additionally ignored `AGENTOS_GATEWAY_URL` entirely and
  always dialled the hardcoded `ws://localhost:18791/ws`.

- Bankr catalog cards all wear the Bankr brand mark again. `aero-stock-lp` is
  the one entry in `BankrBot/skills` whose `catalog.json` ships a `logo`, so it
  rendered that artwork while every other card in the partner tab showed the
  Bankr symbol. The Bankr source now ignores the payload's logo entirely —
  membership in the catalog is the brand, and a repository-side edit can no
  longer repaint a partner card's identity.

- The Control UI bootstrap endpoint no longer leaks host details to any website
  the operator visits. `{control_ui.base_path}/api/bootstrap` sat inside the
  prefix that is exempt from the loopback Origin guard, so with the default
  `cors.allowed_origins = ["*"]` any page could `fetch()` it cross-origin and
  read the absolute config file path (which reveals the OS username) along with
  the configured `auth_mode`. The bootstrap payload no longer carries
  `config_path` at all — the console reads it from the authenticated
  `doctor.status` RPC instead — and the Origin guard's Control UI exemption now
  stops at `{base_path}/api/`, so the shell and its fingerprinted assets stay
  exempt while every JSON route under the prefix is fenced on the loopback
  binds the guard covers. `AuthMiddleware` gets the same narrowing, with a
  single carve-out for `/api/bootstrap` itself, which the console must read
  before it holds a token. Fixes #351.

- `auth.mode = "password"` no longer admits the gateway unauthenticated. The
  mode was advertised and env-bound (`AGENTOS_AUTH_PASSWORD`) but had no branch
  in `AuthMiddleware.dispatch`, so it fell through to the unauthenticated pass
  and left the whole non-RPC surface — `/api/system/status`, `/api/config`,
  `/api/v1/files/upload`, `/api/audio/transcribe` — open on a loopback bind. Any
  typo'd mode did the same. `auth.mode` now validates against the modes the
  gateway actually implements (`none`, `token`, `trusted-proxy`) and refuses
  anything else at load time with a message naming the fix, and the middleware
  fails closed with `401` on any mode without an enforcement branch — the config
  object is read live, so a runtime mutation cannot reopen the hole. `auth.mode`
  is also case- and whitespace-normalized now (`" TOKEN "` loads as `token`), and
  `agentos.toml.example` plus the setup guide no longer list `password` as a
  choice. Closes #352.

- Credential masking no longer rewrites ordinary source code. The
  `Authorization` / `x-api-key` header names matched as substrings
  (`"requiresApiKey": False`), their value ran past the closing bracket
  (`{"xi-api-key": api_key}` lost its `}`), a bare number was masked as a
  credential, a vendor prefix matched mid-base64 (`AKIA…` inside an embedded
  font blob), and a PEM block spanning two adjacent string literals swallowed
  the code between them. Header names now match on a segment boundary, values
  stop at the punctuation that closes them and skip numbers and `<placeholder>`
  forms, prefixes need a left boundary, and a PEM span must have a base64 body.
  A PEM block in a `read_file` window is masked line by line, so the line
  numbers the reader computes its next `offset=` from stay correct.

- The `NAME=value` pass now recognises quoted keys (`"client_secret": "…"`), so
  credentials in JSON and YAML config are masked as the docstring always said
  they were.

### Security

- Installing a skill from ClawHub no longer unpacks the downloaded zip
  unbounded. `ClawHubSource.fetch` read every entry into memory with no cap on
  entry count or uncompressed size, so a few tens of KB of nested deflate — a
  classic zip bomb — could exhaust the gateway's memory and take the process
  down. The download is now streamed against a size ceiling — httpx gunzips a
  `Content-Encoding` body with no limit of its own, so a buffered read could
  have been filled before any zip cap got a say — and the archive is refused
  past an entry count, a per-entry size, and a total uncompressed size. Each
  entry is decompressed in chunks against a running total, so an archive that
  understates `ZipInfo.file_size` is caught mid-read rather than trusted. A
  hostile archive also fails closed rather than raising through the installer:
  an entry flagged encrypted, an unsupported compression method, or a truncated
  deflate stream reaches the caller as "no bundle", not as an exception that
  aborts a whole lockfile sync. Entry paths are also checked against
  Windows-style escapes (`..\`, `C:\`), which
  `posixpath.normpath` leaves intact; previously only the installer's resolve
  check caught those. Closes #357.

- `read_file`, `read_spreadsheet` and `grep_search` now mask credentials in the
  content they hand back to the model, and so do the two channels that quote
  file content alongside them: `edit_file`'s closest-match hint, and terminal
  output from a command that reads a credential file (`cat ~/.aws/credentials`).
  Previously the sensitive-path denylist was the only thing protecting a secrets
  file, and that denylist is lifted entirely under elevated-full mode — which
  cron `agent_turn` jobs run by default — so `read_file ~/.aws/credentials`
  returned the raw keys into the persisted transcript. Masking uses a
  non-reusable `«redacted:…»` sentinel, DSN and URL passwords included, so a
  value read out of a config file cannot be written back over the working one.

  How much of the pass runs depends on the file. Shape-matched credentials
  (`sk-…`, JWTs, PEM blocks) are masked everywhere; the name-driven pass, the
  only one that catches a shapeless secret like `aws_secret_access_key`, runs
  everywhere except source code, where it would mask identifiers and hand back
  code that no longer matches the file. Closes #355.

## [2026.8.24] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Channel tool approvals are now native interactive surfaces. Telegram inline
  keyboards, Slack Block Kit actions, and Discord message components render an
  Approve/Deny pair for a gated tool call instead of asking the operator to type
  a reply. Every click is authorized before it is honoured: the clicker must
  pass the channel's own access policy and be an admitted paired user, the
  approval is bound to the `sessionKey` that raised it so a click from another
  session is refused, and the surface is offered only in DMs, where the session
  key is `PER_CHANNEL_PEER` and the approver is unambiguous. Slack request
  signatures are verified against the raw request body rather than a parsed
  form, so verification no longer depends on the ASGI body having survived a
  read. Closes #364.

- Cost visibility. A usage ledger records the cost of each turn and attributes
  it per tool and per skill through a `ContextVar` that follows the call into
  nested execution, and a new `agentos cost` command queries it with filters for
  session, model, tool, skill, and time range, plus export. The router gains a
  `cost_aware` flag (on by default) that substitutes the cheapest tier capable
  of the request; image-only tiers are filtered out before the comparison, so a
  text request is never routed to an image model. Closes #366.

- Aeon (`aeonfun/aeon`) joins Robinhood, Bankr, and Capminal as a Partner Skills
  source in the Skills hub, with the partner tabs ordered Robinhood, Bankr,
  Aeon, Capminal, Community.

### Fixed

- The gateway no longer accepts an auth token from the query string, where it
  would be captured by proxy and server access logs; the uvicorn access log is
  gated behind `config.debug` for the same reason. Closes #350.

- Rate limiting reads `X-Forwarded-For` only from a verified trusted proxy, and
  the per-client dict is bounded, so a spoofed header can neither bypass the
  limiter nor grow it without limit. Closes #354.

- Unhandled gateway exceptions are redacted before they reach the client; the
  detail is shown only when `debug` is set. Closes #353.

- The `browser` tool refuses `data:` URLs, which could otherwise carry a page
  past the SSRF check and the domain allowlist; `about:blank` remains the only
  permitted hostless target. Closes #356.

- The `usage cost` fallback path declines query filters it cannot honour instead
  of silently dropping them and returning an empty result set.

### Removed

- Dead configuration keys that no code read: `sandbox.network_default` (#360),
  the memory daily-note keys (#405), and `subagents.archive_after_minutes`
  (#407).

### Docs

- `cron_default_mode` — the default elevation posture for unattended cron jobs,
  shipped in 2026.8.21 — is now documented where it is set and where it is read:
  `agentos.toml.example`, the bundled `agentos` skill, and the approvals and
  permissions guide. (#413)

## [2026.8.23] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- A `browser` built-in drives a real browser from the agent, backed by the
  agent-browser CLI (Vercel Labs, Apache-2.0): navigate, read a page as an
  accessibility snapshot with element refs, click, type, fill, wait, run
  JavaScript, answer native dialogs, and screenshot. It runs managed and
  headless by default; attach mode drives the operator's own browser when they
  opt in. Policy is enforced in AgentOS rather than delegated to the engine —
  SSRF checks on navigate and on the post-redirect URL plus a private-page guard
  on reads, `file:` refused while `data:`/`about:` pass, `eval` SSRF-pre-scanned
  in both modes with an opt-in `restrict_evaluate` denylist and a post-eval URL
  recheck, `type`/`fill` refusing credential-shaped text, and every payload the
  engine returns crossing into the transcript inside the untrusted envelope and
  through credential redaction. The engine subprocess starts from a minimal
  environment, never `os.environ`, so the gateway token and provider keys are
  unreachable from it. An optional `allowed_domains` bounds navigation, and the
  tool sits in `group:web`, so denying web denies it.

- Provider failover is now health-aware. A circuit breaker counts consecutive
  provider-health failures (overload / gateway 5xx, transport errors, rate
  limits) per configured provider id; after
  `llm.circuit_breaker.failure_threshold` failures (default 3) the provider is
  skipped for a cooldown window (default 60s, doubling per consecutive trip up to
  `max_cooldown_seconds`), and one half-open probe per window re-closes it when
  the provider recovers. Failover used to be purely reactive and per-request —
  every turn during an outage paid the full timeout on the dead primary before
  falling back, because `ModelSelector` reset to the primary each turn. Breaker
  state is shared across per-turn selector clones, so detection is paid once
  per outage instead of once per turn. Request-shaped failures (unknown model,
  bad request, context overflow, auth, billing) never trip the breaker, and if
  every link in the chain is in cooldown the primary is still used. State is
  surfaced in `agentos providers status` (new `circuit` column),
  `agentos doctor` (`provider.circuit.open` / `provider.circuit.half_open`), and
  `GET /api/system/status` (`circuitBreaker` / `circuitBreakers`). (#365)

### Changed

- Chart artifacts in the Web UI download as a rendered screenshot image instead
  of a raw JSON link, so the button hands over the chart people actually see.

### Fixed

- A pinned turn no longer shows another turn's router-fx strip. The
  `route_pinned` early-return swept only live strips from the dock, so a settled
  strip from an earlier turn lingered above the composer and read as this turn's
  selection even though the composer pill showed the pinned model. Every
  router-fx strip for the current session is now swept on the pinned path —
  live and settled alike — while strips from other sessions are left untouched.
  (#345)

- Skill dependency installs work for every kind a skill can declare. Three
  code paths carried their own idea of what `install.kind` meant — the Skills
  page executor knew `brew`/`uv`/`download`, the `install_skill_deps` tool knew
  `brew`/`node`/`go`/`uv`, and the install hints rendered a third, different set — so the
  seven bundled gmgn skills, which declare `kind: npm`, were uninstallable
  through both executors ("Unsupported install kind: npm"), and `apt` failed
  the same way. All three now read one canonical vocabulary and one command
  builder in `agentos/skills/install_kinds.py`: `brew`, `npm`, `go`, `uv`,
  `download`, and `apt`, with `node` kept working as an alias for `npm`. The
  command shown as an install hint is now literally the command that runs.
  `apt` (needs root) and `download` (needs a fetch plus a chmod) stay
  hint-only, and say so instead of reading as unsupported. A `uv` spec that
  declares `bins` installs with `uv tool install`; one that doesn't — a library
  like `openpyxl` — keeps using `uv pip install`, which the agent tool used to
  get wrong. Pinned versions (`gmgn-cli@1.2.3`, `openpyxl>=3.1`) now survive the
  value allowlists instead of losing their install hint, an `apt` package can no
  longer end in the `-` that turns an install line into a removal, and the
  `download` hint validates and quotes its URL rather than interpolating it
  raw. (#358)

## [2026.8.21] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Inbound Telegram voice messages, audio files, and round video notes are
  transcribed before the turn is built, and the speech-to-text output becomes
  the message text. A voice note used to reach the agent as the placeholder
  `[voice]` with the audio stripped, so the only way to be understood on a
  phone was to type. The ElevenLabs STT call was factored out of
  `audio_transcription.py` into a shared helper and wired into channel message
  ingestion, so `voice`, `audio`, and `video_note` payloads all take the same
  path. A default 120-second duration limit (configurable through
  `max_voice_duration_s`) and a 30 MB size limit are checked before the
  download; over either limit, or on an STT failure, the sender gets a reply
  saying so and the message still reaches the agent under its placeholder
  rather than being dropped. The channel download limit is relaxed to 30 MB for
  `audio/` and `video/` types while the attachment whitelist stays strict —
  raw audio is stripped once transcribed. Group mention detection now also
  admits replies that target the bot, by user id or by username. (#312, #317)
- `agentos skills init <name>` scaffolds a local custom skill that passes the
  publish gate on the first try: a `SKILL.md` with clean YAML frontmatter and a
  body long enough to clear the 20-character validation, plus
  `scripts/run.py` and its entrypoint mapping under `--with-script`. Names are
  validated against `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9.-]{0,63}$` so a name cannot walk out
  of the target directory, and an existing file is only overwritten with
  `--force`; other files in the directory are left alone. The target resolves
  through the usual layer order — `~/.agentos/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`,
  `<workspace>/.agents/skills`, `<workspace>/skills`. (#316, #321)

### Changed

- Scheduled agent turns (`agent_run` cron jobs) are elevated by default,
  running in `bypass` mode instead of needing a per-job opt-in — an unattended
  turn that stops to ask for an approval nobody is there to give is a turn that
  does nothing. The new global `cron_default_mode` field on `PermissionsConfig`
  holds the default, and the router resolves effective elevation at execution
  time from the `handler_key` now carried in the cron envelope. Every other
  unattended kind — reminders, system events, script runs — stays strictly
  unelevated, and an explicit `--no-elevated` on any of them is honoured rather
  than rejected. Elevated warnings log `source="config"` or `source="job"` so
  the log says how elevation was granted, and the effective value is shown on
  Web UI job cards and in the CLI `cron list` table. The wire-level `elevated`
  field keeps meaning "explicit override", so existing jobs read back
  unchanged. (#311, #323)
- Web content the agent reads is wrapped in the same `<untrusted source='…'>`
  envelope the system prompt teaches, through a new `wrap_untrusted_boundary`
  helper in `safety/injection_guard.py`. `web_fetch` had its own
  `<external-content>` tag, which the dispatch layer did not recognize: a
  tool-call marker planted in a fetched page got zero enforcement. It now
  trips the refusal path like any other untrusted fragment. Only nested
  `<untrusted>` markers are entity-escaped, so the page itself passes through
  verbatim and stays readable; the escaping is idempotent, so truncation
  re-wrapping still works. `http_request` wraps its text `body` and
  `body_preview` with the fetched URL as the source, with the 10k text cap
  applying to the payload rather than the envelope. Binary and base64 paths are
  unchanged, and `web_search`/`x_search` snippets stay out of scope. (#339,
  #340)
- The core system prompt drops `## AgentOS CLI Quick Reference` — two
  hardcoded commands that drift from the real CLI, whose canonical references
  are the bundled `agentos` skill and `docs/cli.md` — and folds `## Workspace`
  into `## Runtime`, keeping each line's gating so OS and shell stay full-mode
  only and the working-directory line keeps its own condition. Reply Guidelines
  now open with "Lead with the answer or outcome; keep supporting detail after
  it". Net −124 characters, about 31 tokens, on a full-mode render. (#343,
  #344)

### Fixed

- Section headings in the rendered system prompt are no longer glued to the
  section above them. Any section whose last line was conditional closed with
  `{% endif -%}`, and the right-trim dash swallowed the blank line before the
  next heading — every full-mode prompt shipped so far rendered `# Agent` stuck
  onto `## Product Identity`, `## Image Generation` onto `## Memory Recall`,
  and `## Memory Recall` onto `## Memory Write Guidance`. (#343, #344)

## [2026.8.19] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- A cron job's `script` path may contain `{job_id}`, which the scheduler
  replaces with the created job's own id before the job is persisted, and the
  `cron` tool's add result now reports the resolved path as `script_path`. A
  job that keeps its files in a directory named after itself could not name that
  directory at creation time, because the id is minted by the create: the only
  route there was to stage the script elsewhere, add the job against the staging
  path, move the file, and repoint the job — four steps during which a live job
  points at a path it will not keep, and any run abandoned midway leaves files
  behind that nothing can attribute to a job. One `add` now does it. Works for
  a `script` job and for an `agent_turn` job's pre-run script, from the tool,
  the CLI, and the RPC surface alike, because the substitution happens in
  `SchedulerOps`. A stored path that somehow still holds the placeholder refuses
  to run rather than creating a directory called `{job_id}`. (#332)
- Skills can pin a section so `skill_view` returns it wherever it sits in the
  file: `<!-- always -->` on the line directly above a heading. Over the read
  ceiling `skill_view` returns a skill's opening sections plus an index of the
  rest, so position in the file decided what a model actually read — and a rule
  written into a large skill's tail was never seen unless the model thought to
  ask for that section. `senior-unilp-manager` is 44k characters against a 10k
  ceiling, and two merged fixes wrote their rules past the cut; neither reached
  the model, and the next run repeated both mistakes. Pinned sections come out
  of the same ceiling rather than adding to it — at most half of it, with the
  opening taking what is left — and the index marks them as already shown.
  `skill_view.outlined` is now logged at INFO with a `pinned` count, because it
  is the only event that says most of a skill did not reach the model. Pinning
  governs what one `skill_view` call returns; what survives into later turns is
  the transcript's business, fixed separately in #334. (#332)

### Fixed

- A tool may now declare the ceiling its own results are persisted under, and
  `skill_view` sets one from `[skills].max_skill_view_chars`. Every tool result
  was written to the transcript truncated to its first 2,000 characters, so a
  skill body read on one turn came back on the next as an opening that stops
  mid-sentence — and 40 of the 50 bundled skills are larger than that. A session
  read `senior-unilp-manager`, saw the pinned directory rule from #332 in an
  11,996-character result, and one turn later replayed 2,000 characters that did
  not contain it and wrote the files flat. Nothing downstream could recover it:
  the request builder compacts from what was persisted, not from the original,
  so the layer under no pressure at all — writing one SQLite row — was cutting
  harder, and more crudely, than the layer that has a budget to defend. The
  ceiling is resolved when a result is persisted rather than at registration, so
  it follows a config change, and a tool that declares nothing keeps the 2,000
  characters that suit volatile output. (#334)

- Web chat: copying an assistant message no longer prepends the collapsible
  reasoning block. `extractBubbleText()` cloned `.msg-body` and stripped only
  `.msg-actions` and `.msg-meta`, so the `Thinking` summary label — and the
  full reasoning body once the block had been expanded — landed in the
  clipboard ahead of the reply. `.thinking-block` now joins the strip list, so
  copy yields the reply text alone whether the block is collapsed or expanded.
  (#322)

### Changed

- The core system prompt was rewritten and is now gated by surface. Tool Call
  Style teaches parallel tool batches and a verify-with-tools bias instead of
  the no-op "wait for tool results" line, a new Task Execution block carries a
  persistence rule with an anti-stuck escape hatch and an explicit
  approval-denial boundary, and Safety gained irreversible/outward action
  confirmation, secrets handling, and the `<untrusted>` envelope convention
  with its coverage caveat. Reply Tags, Messaging and Reactions now render only
  when at least one channel adapter is configured, and Silent Replies only for
  sessions that can receive internal system events, so a pure Web UI/CLI
  gateway no longer teaches reply-tag syntax, emoji reactions, or a `NO_REPLY`
  sentinel it can never legitimately use — roughly 257 tokens saved per
  full-mode session. Both gates are boot-time or session-kind stable, so the
  cacheable base prompt does not churn. Section-level contract tests pin each
  block per prompt mode and tool set. (#336, #338)
- `senior-unilp-manager`'s monitor layout is now one `cron` call and one pinned
  section. "Files on disk for a monitor" became "Setting up a monitor", shrank
  from 4 238 characters to roughly 2 100 — the stage-add-move-repoint sequence
  it existed to explain is replaced by `script="senior-unilp-manager/{job_id}/
  tick.sh"` — and carries `<!-- always -->`, so it reaches the model whatever
  the read ceiling is. The rule that a monitor is a `script` job unless a model
  in the loop was asked for moved into that section for the same reason: it sat
  past the cut too, and the run that motivated this shipped an agent task the
  user had to correct by hand. (#332)
- `senior-unilp-manager` now defaults the ratchet monitor to a `script` cron
  job. "Wiring it to cron" leads with the `job_kind="script"` shape and states
  the rule outright: if the user did not say which shape they want, schedule
  the script job. `agent_turn` is documented as the explicit opt-in for when a
  model is wanted in the loop — to summarize or escalate in its own words —
  with its cost named, a full turn on every tick of a job that is almost always
  a no-op. `tick` already reconciles and fires in one process, so the script
  shape costs no model call, takes no `tool_policy`, and with `--alert-only`
  stays quiet on a healthy ratchet. Instructions only; no behaviour changed.
  (#325)
- `senior-unilp-manager` now has a file layout for the monitors it sets up.
  Every file a ratchet monitor needs — `tick.sh`, any helper the agent writes
  for it, any scratch the run keeps — lives under
  `~/.agentos/scripts/senior-unilp-manager/<cron_id>/` and nowhere else, so the
  mapping from job to files is one-to-one: delete the job, delete the
  directory. Previously the skill said only "a script under
  `~/.agentos/scripts/`", and each run invented its own names in a directory
  shared with every other skill's jobs, which left nothing that could be
  cleaned up when a mandate was disarmed. The skill now also says explicitly
  that mandate state is not part of that directory — the mandate JSON, the
  write-ahead log, and the lock stay under `$UNILP_STATE_DIR` /
  `$AGENTOS_HOME/state/unilp` / `~/.agentos/state/unilp` — and spells out the
  stage-then-repoint ordering, since a cron id does not exist until its job
  does, and the teardown that the layout is there to make possible: remove the
  job, then remove its directory. Skill instructions only; subdirectories under
  the scripts directory were already supported. (#326)

## [2026.8.17] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- The in-agent `cron` tool can name where a job announces. `add` takes an
  optional `delivery` object — `mode` (`origin`, `channel`, or `none`),
  `channel_name`, `channel_id`, `account_id`, `thread_id`, and `best_effort` —
  so "every weekday at 9, post the digest to the ops group" no longer has to be
  created in the chat that will receive it. Omitting `delivery` keeps the
  existing behaviour exactly: the job reports back to the calling conversation.
  The destination is validated when the job is saved rather than when it fires,
  so an unconfigured channel name, an AgentOS session key passed where the
  provider's chat id belongs, or a destination paired with a mode that cannot
  route to it are all refused with an error naming the problem — silently
  falling back to the calling chat is what made a misdirected job look like a
  working one. The `add` response echoes the resolved destination, and a clone
  given a `delivery` is redirected rather than inheriting the source's.
  Choosing a channel requires an interactive CLI or Web caller and a
  `session_target` other than `main`; webhook delivery and failure destinations
  remain CLI-, Web-, and RPC-only. (#310)
- `cron(action="update")` accepts `delivery` too, so moving an existing job's
  announcement is an edit rather than a rebuild. Refusing it left the model one
  route to "post that job to Telegram instead" — remove the job and add a
  replacement — which threw away the job id the user had just named along with
  its whole run history, and in practice the refusal message pointed at the CLI,
  the Web UI, and the RPC, none of which an agent in a chat can reach, so the
  same failing call was retried until the turn was interrupted. A repoint keeps
  the job's id, run history, `ws_topic` (so existing websocket subscribers stay
  attached), and failure destination, and applies the same gates as `add`:
  `mode='channel'` needs an interactive CLI or Web caller and a `session_target`
  other than `main`, the recipient is validated at save time, and a chat caller
  cannot repoint a job that already reports somewhere that chat cannot address.
  (#310)
- Sessions can be renamed. A new `sessions.rename` RPC sets (or clears) a
  session's `display_name`, and it is reachable from every surface:
  `agentos sessions rename <id> "<name>"` (`--clear` drops it), `/rename <name>`
  in CLI chat — gateway and standalone — and in chat channels, and
  click-to-edit on a row in the Web UI session list. `agentos sessions list`
  grows a `Name` column and a `--search`/`-q` filter that matches the name,
  key, subject, or model; `sessions.list` now ships `derived_title`, so the Web
  UI's existing name-aware filter works on real data. Names are normalized in
  one place (`agentos.session.naming`): whitespace collapses to a single line,
  control characters are dropped, the value is capped at 120 characters, and an
  empty name clears the label so the derived title takes over. Because renames
  resolve a target the same way `/resume` does, a session can be renamed by its
  current name instead of its full key — an exact name now beats a prefix
  match, so naming a session `agent` no longer collides with every session
  key. `--search` widens its fetch beyond `--limit` so it can reach older
  sessions, and names are Rich-escaped everywhere the CLI prints them, so a
  name containing `[/]` can no longer break `sessions list`. No migration is
  required — the `display_name` column already existed. (#248)
- Renaming reaches the Chat view itself. The header `⋯` menu gains **Rename
  session**, which edits the name in place — Enter saves, Escape cancels the
  edit without closing the menu, and an empty value clears the name. Once a
  session has one, the header chip shows the name instead of the key (the key
  stays in the chip's tooltip and in **Copy session key**), and the session
  switcher lists each renamed session by name with its key underneath. The
  switcher's search now matches the name and the derived title as well as the
  key, so a session is findable there by the label it was given — the same
  search behaviour the Sessions page already had. Agents can rename too: the
  new `session_rename` tool sets or clears the name of the session it is
  running in — and only that one — so "call this one X" works as a prompt. It
  shares the `agentos.session.naming` normalizer with every other rename path,
  and reports rather than silently succeeding when storage cannot persist the
  change. (#248)

### Fixed

- The in-agent `cron` tool can now edit a job instead of replacing it. Asking
  the agent in chat to change a scheduled job's prompt — or to "clone this one
  but …" — used to leave it no strategy but `add` a new job and `remove` the
  original, which deleted the job the user wanted to keep and reset every
  setting the re-create did not name: an `agent_turn` fell back to `reminder`,
  a job pinned to `Asia/Bangkok` moved to UTC, its tool policy was dropped,
  and its output started landing in the current chat instead of the channel it
  reported to. The tool gains `action="update"` (patch in place, keeping the
  job id), `action="get"` (the full record — kind, tz, schedule, session
  target, delivery, tool policy, wake mode, timeout, script fields), a
  `clone_from` parameter on `add` that inherits every setting of the source and
  overrides only what is passed, and a `name` parameter so a job's display name
  no longer has to be its prompt. Jobs carrying a script or
  `tool_policy.elevated` stay operator-only to clone or update, a channel
  caller cannot clone or rewrite a job that reports to a destination its own
  chat cannot address, and `action="get"` names a webhook's host without
  disclosing the URL path or token. (#309)
- Rescheduling a one-shot cron job onto a recurring expression no longer leaves
  `delete_after_run` set, which made the edited job delete itself after its
  first fire. Converting a job away from `agent_turn` now drops a stranded
  `tool_policy.elevated` instead of persisting a combination `cron add` refuses
  to create, and a `tool_policy` sent alongside a kind change is validated
  against the new kind rather than the outgoing one. All three are in
  `SchedulerOps.update`, so the `cron.update` RPC and the Web UI edit flow get
  them too.

## [2026.8.15] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- A built-in Tavily provider joins the `web_search` backends. It is a runtime
  provider like `brave` and `duckduckgo` — not a skill-only engine — so
  selecting `tavily` and setting `TAVILY_API_KEY` is all it takes; onboarding
  offers it alongside the other keyed providers, and the key is redacted in
  logs and transcripts like every other credential.
- The Web UI now shows a "new release available" banner, closing the gap with
  the CLI, which has warned about outdated installs for several releases. An
  `updates.check` RPC method reports the running version, the latest version on
  PyPI and a `up-to-date` / `outdated` / `offline` status; the console renders
  the banner only on `outdated`. The check reuses the CLI's cached PyPI state
  with its own `webui` slot, so the browser does not add PyPI traffic beyond
  the existing interval, and it stays silent when `AGENTOS_NO_UPDATE_NOTICE=1`
  is set or `updates.notify` is off. `pypi_client` and `version_utils` moved
  from `agentos.cli` to `agentos.compat` so the gateway can use them without
  importing the CLI.
- Gmail/GitHub-style navigation chords land in the Web UI: press `g`, then a
  destination key within 1.5s, and every sidebar view is reachable from the
  keyboard. The prefix re-arms on a repeated `g` and is cancelled by Escape or
  any held modifier; each chord closes the mobile drawer and moves focus to the
  main content region. The `?` cheat sheet renders multi-step chords through
  the `t()` seam, and `docs/web-ui.md` documents the full set.

### Fixed

- The per-message hover toolbar (copy / regenerate / edit) could not be
  clicked. It sits in the outer gutter, outside the `.msg` box that carries the
  `:hover` state, so crossing the 8px margin dropped the hover and faded the
  buttons out — while the reveal animation slid them away from the incoming
  pointer. A transparent bridge pseudo-element now makes the hit region
  continuous and the `translateX` reveal is gone. The bridge is suppressed on
  narrow viewports and under `hover: none`, where the toolbar is already in
  normal flow.
- `x_search` could hand a single attempt a timeout slightly larger than the
  whole budget it was meant to fit inside. The per-attempt timeout came from
  `deadline - time.monotonic()`, and on a coarse clock (Windows resolves
  `monotonic()` to ~15.6ms) both reads land in the same tick, so the expression
  collapses to a rounded `(t + total) - t` that can exceed `total`. The
  per-attempt timeout is now capped on the total budget as well, so the
  invariant holds at any clock granularity.

## [2026.8.13] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- A bundled `poolsdotfun-token-launcher` crypto skill launches a token on
  pools.fun through the `PartyFactory` on Robinhood Chain (4663) and manages the
  creator fees on the `PartyLocker` afterwards. A launch is one irreversible
  transaction: it CREATE2-deploys a fixed-supply ERC20 with no owner and no mint
  function, opens a SushiSwap V3 pool at the 1% fee tier, and mints the whole
  supply as a single-sided full-range position whose LP NFT goes to the locker
  permanently — the launcher never holds it. The chain and RPC endpoint are
  built in, so there is nothing to configure beyond `POOLSFUN_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- The skill separates reading from signing. `pools_read.py` quotes cost, opening
  price and pool state, simulates a launch and mines a launch salt using only a
  `--from` address; `pools_write.py` is the only script that can sign. A launch
  plan is hashed, so the transaction that broadcasts is provably the one that
  was quoted.
- `PINATA_JWT` is optional and needed only to attach a token image. It is
  deliberately not declared as a skill requirement, so a launch without a logo
  still works on a machine where Pinata was never configured.

### Fixed

- The launcher can now find a logo the user attached in chat. Chat attachments
  arrive in two shapes — staged to disk under a sha256 name, or inlined as
  base64 in the transcript — and the skill previously looked only at the media
  directory, so an inlined image was missed and a stale disk blob could be
  uploaded in its place. A `find-image` read command now resolves the image from
  the transcript first, materializes it, and warns when the only candidate is
  older than the request.

## [2026.8.12] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- The Web UI now shows the model thinking. Reasoning arrives as a typed
  `ThinkingDeltaEvent` from the Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible and Ollama
  providers — including models that emit `<think>` tags inline, split back out
  of the text stream as it arrives — and renders as a live collapsible block
  that folds itself the moment the reply text starts. A fresh block opens per
  reasoning round, so mid-turn work stays visible rather than being appended to
  the first one. History carries a `has_thinking` flag so a reloaded thread
  still offers the block. `control_ui.show_thinking` (default true) gates the
  whole surface.
- Thinking is web-only by construction. It travels on a `session.event.thinking`
  emit path and a CONTROL_ONLY `chat.thinking` RPC, so channel adapters never
  receive it — reasoning is not something to page a Telegram or Discord thread
  with.
- The chat composer now carries a route picker, so choosing which model answers
  no longer means remembering a slash command. It lists the text tiers your
  `[agentos_router]` config actually defines — labelled with the model each
  resolves to, e.g. `c1 · gpt-5.6-luna` — plus `Auto`, which hands routing back
  to the Pilot Router and reports the tier it last chose (`Auto · c2`) so
  automatic routing stays legible. The pin is read back from the gateway over a
  new `router.hold.get` RPC rather than mirrored in the browser, so a reload
  shows the pin that is really in force and a pin set from `/c3` and one set
  from the picker agree. With no Pilot Router configured the control is disabled
  rather than hidden, keeping the composer from reflowing when the router is
  toggled.
- The picker is a searchable list, so the choice is not limited to the four
  configured tiers: it also offers every model of the active provider, and
  `/use <model-id>` does the same from a slash command on web, TUI and channels.
  A directly-named model rides on the default tier, inheriting the thinking
  level and pricing baseline that live on a tier and not on a model id — which
  also keeps the router step's `tiers[hold.tier]` lookup valid. Only the active
  provider's models are offered: every turn runs through the single configured
  `llm.provider` (a tier's `provider` field is metadata, not a client selector),
  so anything else is refused when chosen rather than failing on the next turn.
  `/use` is a new verb rather than an argument to `/model`, whose argument
  already filters the listing. Only models the provider publishes in its
  catalog can be pinned — on OpenCAP that is the bare canonical ids, not the
  namespaced `<upstream>/<model>` aliases its inference endpoint also answers to.
- The router-fx strip is suppressed while a tier or model is pinned. It exists
  to show the router weighing candidates and settling on one; a pin decides the
  route up front, so the animation was dramatizing a deliberation that never
  happened and restating the composer's own picker every turn. It returns the
  moment routing goes back to Auto.
- A pin now withdraws the model's own `router_control` tool for the duration,
  along with its target menu in the system prompt. The user's choice already
  outranked the model inside the router step; leaving the lever on the surface
  only invited calls that could not take effect and paid tokens to describe
  them. Holds the model installs for itself are unaffected — hiding the tool on
  its own hold would strand a session on a transient escalation.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** a tier pin set by a user is now sticky. `/c0`…`/c3` — in the Web
  UI, the TUI, and every channel — hold until `/auto` clears them instead of
  lapsing after ten idle minutes. A pin is a standing instruction, and a
  selection that silently reverted would have made the new composer control lie
  about what is running. The practical consequence is a bill: pin `/c3` and
  forget, and every later turn keeps paying for `c3` until someone runs `/auto`.
  Routing the model chooses for itself mid-turn is unchanged and still lapses on
  its own. Two things still outrank a pin, both pre-existing: image turns are
  routed to a vision tier before pins are consulted (the Web UI flags such a
  turn), and a pinned turn skips the large-context tier floor, so it fails at
  the provider rather than being upgraded if the conversation outgrows the
  pinned model's context window.

### Fixed

- A hub skill whose `SKILL.md` renames itself no longer renders as a local one.
  The lockfile is keyed by the install directory but was read back by the name
  the frontmatter declares, and published skills do rename themselves — hub
  `ytdlp-transcript` ships a manifest named `youtube-transcript`. The lookup
  missed, so an ordinary hub install appeared under "Your local skills" with no
  source, no version, no scan facts and neither a Remove nor an Update button,
  the same wrong row reaching `agentos skills list` and the agent's
  `skill_list`. Entries now join by the resolved path they already record,
  falling back to the name for entries written before `path` existed. The
  removability guard read the manifest name too and so reported a removable
  install as an orphan; `skills.uninstall` and `skills.update` — and the CLI's
  no-gateway uninstall path — now translate to the install key the same way.
  The wire contract is unchanged and existing installs heal themselves: no
  lockfile migration, no re-install.
- OpenCAP and Bankr routes reported `supports_reasoning=False` for every model,
  which silently no-oped a tier's `thinking_level`.

## [2026.8.11] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- A built-in `x_search` tool searches X (Twitter) through xAI's server-side
  search on the Responses API, returning a synthesized answer with citations
  rather than the ranked pages a web search provider returns — so it is its own
  tool, not a `web_search` backend. It joins `group:web`, so denying that group
  also cuts the route to `api.x.ai`, and it is allowed for cron agents next to
  `web_fetch`/`web_search` because it is read-only. Visibility follows the
  `image_generation` pattern: an install with no xAI credential never pays the
  tool's schema on a provider call. Retries are deadline-aware —
  `timeout_seconds` bounds one attempt and `total_timeout_seconds` the whole
  call — and `base_url` must be HTTPS and is refused if it resolves to a
  metadata endpoint. `x_search` bills xAI directly and does not appear in
  `agentos cost`. Configure it at `[x_search]` with hot-apply, from the Setup
  page, or with `agentos configure x-search`. (Fixes #277)
- SuperGrok and X Premium+ subscribers can now sign in to xAI instead of pasting
  an API key, which is the only way to spend a subscription on `x_search` — xAI
  sells API credit and subscriptions separately, and a subscriber holds no key.
  `agentos auth login xai` runs the device-code flow, tokens land in
  `~/.agentos/auth.json` (0600) and refresh themselves, `agentos auth status`
  reports the login without printing a token, and `agentos auth logout xai`
  forgets it. OAuth is preferred over `XAI_API_KEY` at call time, and
  `credential_source` says which one ran. Discovery and inference origins are
  pinned to HTTPS on `x.ai`/`*.x.ai` on both the login and refresh paths, a
  `403` on refresh is reported as a tier gate rather than a re-login prompt, a
  terminal refusal quarantines the dead tokens, and refresh is serialized by a
  lock because xAI's refresh tokens are single-use. The Setup page can drive the
  same flow without blocking, over a split `start`/`poll` pair, and offers
  "Sign out of xAI" once signed in; the device code never crosses to the
  browser. Signing out forgets local tokens only — nothing is revoked at xAI,
  and `x_search` falls back to `XAI_API_KEY` if one is set.
- Every Web UI view now resolves its copy through the i18n seam. The shell and
  all sixteen views — chat, setup, config, settings, agents, sessions, usage,
  skills, channels, mcp, cron and the rest — read from per-namespace catalogs
  instead of carrying hardcoded English, with an `I18N_MIGRATED` ESLint ledger
  guarding each migrated file against regressions. Two rules back it:
  user-facing copy must come from `t()`, and `t()` must be called at render
  time, since a module-scope call freezes the locale at boot. Catalogs are
  registered per namespace so a view's copy stays out of the entry chunk,
  numeric placeholders format through `Intl.NumberFormat`, and malformed locale
  tags are rejected at registration rather than throwing later in `tPlural()`.
  The visible language is unchanged. (Fixes #138, #257, #258, #259, #260, #261)
- Translation requests now route to the cheapest tier. The router scores
  reasoning difficulty rather than task type, so an ordinary "translate this"
  landed on `c1` even in English — and because the Pilot corpus is English-only,
  the same request drifted a tier in either direction depending only on the
  language it was written in: measured against the English baseline, `trivial`
  moved from `c0` to `c1`/`c2` in 13 of 14 languages, while a genuinely hard
  request in Chinese, Japanese, or Thai *dropped* to `c1`. A deterministic
  detector now recognises a translate verb in the first or last paragraph of a
  turn across English, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Indonesian,
  French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, and Hindi, and caps the
  turn at `agentos_router.translate_ceiling_tier` (default `c0`; set
  `translate_ceiling_enabled = false` to turn it off, or pick the tier in the
  setup wizard's **Translation cap** field). Every detected translation is
  capped, extras and all — a complaint upgrade, the large-context floor, and a
  programming language named as the target ("translate this Python module to
  Rust", a request to write code) are the only things that override it. Verb
  matching is word-bounded and guarded against overloaded stems, so Vietnamese
  `giao dịch`/`dịch vụ`, English "address translation bug", and Thai `แปลก` are
  not mistaken for translation work.

### Fixed

- Streaming channels show the typing indicator again while the model is still
  thinking. Since Telegram gained `send_streaming` its stream policy resolved to
  `adapter_stream`, which suppressed the indicator for the whole turn — and
  nothing can be streamed before the first token, so a user waiting out model
  latency and tool calls saw nothing at all. Telegram and Discord now type until
  the first chunk reaches the chat and drop the indicator the moment it lands,
  rather than either suppressing it for the run or letting it flicker back under
  a message that is already being edited. `typing_final` and `final_only`
  adapters are unchanged. (Fixes #255)
- External links in the Web UI transcript open in a new tab instead of replacing
  the chat, and a rejected sign-out is reported as a sign-out failure rather
  than "Sign-in failed" — both paths used to render through one label, pointing
  the operator at the wrong thing right after a successful sign-in.
- Writing the auth token store no longer fails on platforms without POSIX mode
  bits.

## [2026.8.9] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Telegram replies now stream: AgentOS posts one message and edits it as the
  answer arrives, instead of showing a typing indicator for the whole run and
  then dropping the finished answer in at once. Edits are throttled to
  Telegram's stricter rate limit, answers longer than 4096 characters roll over
  into a follow-up message, and a burst of `429`s degrades to a single final
  send with the full text intact. Adapters that implement streaming (Slack,
  Discord, Telegram, Microsoft Teams) now declare the `streaming` capability, so
  the manifest and the Channels page reflect what they actually do.
  (Fixes #141)

### Changed

- The seven bundled GMGN skills now declare `category: crypto`, so the Skills
  page files them under **AgentOS Crypto Skills** instead of "AgentOS Normal
  Skills", and each card and detail dialog wears the GMGN mark badged with that
  skill's own emoji rather than the generic package glyph. The mark is chosen on
  `provenance.origin` behind the same shipped/bundled gate as the group itself,
  so a local drop-in cannot mint it, and it ships with the client, so no card
  fetches a remote image. Skill names are unchanged. (Fixes #246)
- A model's price, context window, max output and image support are now declared
  once, in `agentos.model_registry`; the pricing table, the catalog's window
  fallbacks and the router tier defaults are derived from it instead of
  restating it. Bumping a tier default used to mean editing four or five files
  by hand with nothing checking that you did — and because both lookup tables
  fail open in opposite directions, a forgotten entry produced a plausible wrong
  number rather than an error. Shipping a tier default whose model is not
  declared now fails at import. No prices or windows change. (Fixes #140)

### Fixed

- Shell workspace lockdown no longer misses a redirection whose operator has no
  whitespace around it. `echo x>/etc/passwd` and `cat<in>/etc/x` used to parse as
  having no write target at all, because the scan required a space or
  start-of-string before `>`; the same anchor bug was in the `tee` parser. File
  descriptor duplications (`2>&1`, `>&2`, `2>&-`) are blanked before the scan, so
  dropping the anchor does not turn every `2>&1` into a write to a file named
  `1`. (Fixes #197)

## [2026.8.7] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- Switching from a cloud LLM provider back to a local one no longer disables the
  router or leaves it pinned to the cloud provider's tier profile. (Fixes #189)
- Gateway boot and `agentos doctor` now warn when the bundled React Control UI is
  older than the frontend sources in a checkout (`gateway.control_ui.dist_stale`),
  instead of reporting a clean bill of health while serving a stale web UI. The
  warning is advisory and never gates readiness — source mtimes are a hint, not
  an oracle. Wheel installs ship no frontend sources and are never flagged.
  (Fixes #200)

### Added

- Onboarding remembers a per-provider profile when you switch LLM providers and
  restores it when you return: the model, the non-secret connection settings
  (`base_url`, `proxy`, `api_key_env`, `max_tokens`, `thinking`, provider
  routing), and that provider's router slice (enabled, tier profile, tiers you
  authored, Smart Routing judge target). Install-wide router settings —
  `strategy`, `default_tier`, the Pilot thresholds, judge tuning — stay global
  and are never reverted by a switch. Machine-written tier tables are re-derived
  rather than frozen, so upgrades still move you onto the current recommended
  models. Credentials are never copied into a profile. See
  [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md). (Refs #188)
- Token price charts render inline in Web UI chat. An artifact published as
  `application/vnd.agentos.chart+json` draws as an interactive candlestick chart
  in the transcript instead of a download chip, and both `gmgn-market` and
  `gmgn-token` ship the converter that emits one alongside their text summaries.
  A readout strip above the canvas carries the hovered candle's time, OHLC,
  volume, and close-against-open as a signed percentage at the payload's own
  precision. The chart rides the existing artifact seam, so history replay
  redraws it with no separate path; `lightweight-charts` loads dynamically and
  never enters a chat that has no chart. Payload strings are attacker-controlled
  on-chain metadata and reach the DOM only through `textContent`. See
  [docs/artifacts-and-media.md](docs/artifacts-and-media.md) for the contract a
  skill has to meet to publish one.
- The Web UI has one keyboard shortcut registry and a `?` overlay that lists
  every binding. Components declare a shortcut instead of attaching their own
  document listener, so the editable-target and overlay guards live in one place
  and dialogs register themselves as layers rather than being matched by a
  hardcoded selector list. Combos match on both `e.key` and `e.code`, and the
  New chat tooltip renders the right keycaps per platform instead of a hardcoded
  `⌘⇧O`. The sheet loads lazily. (Closes #137)
- Agent settings → Router Tiers picks tier models from a catalog instead of
  free text. The provider cell is a read-only chip — requests always go through
  `llm.provider`, and save writes it on every tier — while the model cell is a
  combobox over the union of the live `models.list` catalog and the shipped
  `onboarding.catalog.routerProfiles`, so neither an offline install nor a
  provider the gateway has no catalog for produces a false warning. The image
  tier is offered only vision-capable models. Save warns and never blocks, and
  distinguishes an unknown id, an image tier pointed at a model with no vision
  capability, and having no catalog to check against. Context window and price
  per 1M render under the entered model. (Closes #142)

### Documentation

- `features/skills.md` and the tools reference now name the mimes that render
  inline and link to the artifact contract, so a skill author can find out that
  publishing one mime rather than another is the difference between a chart and
  a download chip. Both chart sections say to keep `--output` a bare filename,
  since `publish_artifact` only accepts files under the active workspace.

## [2026.8.6] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- A cron job can run a script instead of a model turn. `--job-kind script`
  makes the script the job: its stdout is delivered verbatim, empty stdout is a
  silent tick, and a non-zero exit delivers the error and fails the job so a
  broken watchdog cannot be mistaken for a quiet one. `--job-kind agent_turn
  --script` runs the script first as a collector — its stdout is prepended to
  the prompt as a `## Script output` block, and a tick that prints nothing (or
  ends with `{"wakeAgent": false}`) skips the turn before the session is
  touched, leaving no session row, transcript line, or model call behind.
  Scripts resolve inside `~/.agentos/scripts/`; absolute paths, `~`, `..`, and
  symlinks out of it are refused, and arguments are exec'd as argv, never handed
  to a shell. Scheduling one requires an interactive CLI or Web caller — the
  in-agent `cron` tool refuses it from a chat channel. (Refs #219)
- New bundled skill `cron-watchers` ships the three script jobs everyone writes
  first — an RSS/Atom feed, a JSON endpoint, and a GitHub repo — each following
  the contract the scheduler expects: print what is new, print nothing when
  nothing is new, exit non-zero on a real failure. Deduplication state lives in
  `~/.agentos/state/cron-watchers/<name>.json`, outside the scripts directory,
  and the first run reports nothing by default. (Refs #219)
- `agentos cron output <job-id> [--run <run-id>]` and the `cron.runOutput` RPC
  read one run's output in full; the in-agent `cron` tool gains
  `action="runs"`, so "what did the watcher report?" is a question the model can
  look up instead of invent.
- `senior-unilp-manager` can open the pool a position lives in.
  `lp_write.py create-pool` initializes hook-less Uniswap v4 pools —
  `hooks` is pinned to `address(0)` with no flag to change it, a dynamic fee is
  refused, an odd fee/tick-spacing pair needs `--allow-odd-tier` because `pools`
  only searches the vanilla tiers, and an already-initialized pool prints its
  poolId and exits without planning. The starting price can never be corrected
  afterwards, so the plan table prints tick, `sqrtPriceX96`, and the price in
  both directions under a banner saying so. selftest goes 695 → 716 assertions.
- `tick --json --alert-only` lets a `senior-unilp-manager` ratchet cron stay
  quiet. A tick that found nothing still prints the whole payload — the run
  history keeps it — but ends on `{"wakeAgent": false}`, which
  `has_actionable_output()` reads as "no news": the run succeeds and nothing is
  delivered. A tick that fired, adopted a landed fire, halted, was rejected,
  expired, or built a plan on a dry run is delivered as usual, and
  `NEEDS_ATTENTION` deliberately alerts on every tick — it is a terminal state,
  so filtering on the action alone would silence the one alarm that must never
  go quiet. (Closes #234)
- `lp_read.py price --tokens` is documented (SKILL.md §6b), with the rule to use
  it rather than deriving a price from a pool — a session derived a token's
  price from a zero-TVL dust pool, was off by 3×, and that number would have
  become the permanent starting tick of a new pool. (Refs #228)

### Fixed

- A bad cron delivery target is rejected at save time instead of failing every
  run. `validate_channel_target` refuses an id beginning with a session-key
  prefix (`agent:`, `cron:`, `webchat:`, `session:`) and requires an integer or
  `@username` for Telegram, suggesting the id that would have worked; `cron.add`
  and `cron.update` then ask the adapter itself via `TelegramChannel.probe_target`,
  where only a definite "no" blocks the save. The new `channels.deliveryTargets`
  RPC lists each channel's paired DMs and configured group chats, so the Web UI
  renders Recipient as a dropdown with `Enter manually…` as the escape hatch.
- A cron run record now carries *why* delivery failed. `DeliveryReport.channel_detail`
  turns one line of "delivery failed" into "delivery to telegram failed: Bad
  Request: chat not found" in `agentos cron runs`, and an exception escaping the
  channel leg reports its type instead of vanishing into `asyncio.gather`.
- `structlog` events reach `~/.agentos/logs/debug.log`. Half this codebase logs
  through `logging.getLogger` and half through structlog, and only the first half
  was written to the file — the missing half included every `delivery.*` warning.
- A cron run's output is stored whole. `clamp_run_output` replaces the scattered
  `[:500]` slices that truncated a script job's stdout on the way into the
  database; `preview_summary` is what the delivery layer and the run list get,
  and the Web UI's expanded row fetches the full text lazily.
- The "→ Chat" button no longer leads to "Could not load chat history." Each run
  reports `chatAvailable` and the button is hidden when it is false — script jobs
  never create a session, and isolated agent sessions are reaped after 24h — while
  `chat.history` answers an empty transcript for a missing cron session instead of
  raising.
- The session reaper is paged. `list_sessions()` returns the 100 most recently
  updated sessions — precisely the ones that are *not* expired — so expired
  isolated cron sessions were never reaped on a busy store.
- A script job's output no longer vanishes. Several skips in the delivery chain
  encode "the run already wrote this into the session", which holds for an agent
  turn but not for a script, which has no turn: a job with `sessionTarget=current`
  from webchat was reported delivered without a byte being written, and a job
  bound to the chat its run *is* was skipped on `origin == session_key`. A
  `cron add --script` from the CLI, which genuinely has nowhere to write, now
  reports `no_session_target` rather than a bare `skipped`.
- A cron tool refusal reaches the model. Cron raises plain `ToolError` in ~30
  places with field-naming messages that `envelope.py` discarded, so a call
  carrying `tool_policy.elevated` on a script job came back as "received an
  invalid argument" followed by seven retries that dropped the required
  `schedule` field. Cron's refusals are `SafeToolError` now, and `job_kind='script'`
  + `tool_policy.elevated` is rejected up front, naming the field. (Refs #228)
- A quoted script path is unwrapped before it is stored. A model passes
  `script='"watch-memory.sh"'` often enough that it is the first thing that
  happens; the job saved cleanly and failed on its first tick. (Refs #219)
- `/reset` clears the visible conversation on web and CLI. `sessions.reset` keeps
  the session key and only rotates `session_id`, so the transcript on screen
  stayed put, which reads as "nothing happened". The Web UI clears on
  `session.epoch_changed`, which covers the typed `/reset`, the slash menu, the
  SessionChip button, and a reset issued by another client; the CLI gains
  `ChatApplication.clear_screen()`, which drops scrollback too.
- Two `senior-unilp-manager` doc commands were unrunnable — `python3 <S>/ratchet.py`
  reads as a redirect from a file named `S` in a shell — and the cron examples
  cannot use `$S` at all, since a cron job runs in a fresh isolated session. Both
  now spell out `{baseDir}/scripts/ratchet.py`. (Refs #228)

### Changed

- The cron surfaces say "no LLM" instead of "no model", and `agentos cron runs`
  grows Delivery and Output columns.

## [2026.8.5] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- The `senior-unilp-manager` skill can run an unattended take-profit ratchet on
  a one-sided Uniswap v4 position. `ratchet.py` arms a mandate that, at fixed
  milestones measured against the **original** principal, exits the position,
  keeps the converted side as realized profit, and redeploys only the
  unconverted remainder into a narrower range running from the current price to
  the original far edge. A fire is a single `modifyLiquidities` — DECREASE →
  BURN → MINT → TAKE_PAIR with no SETTLE leg — so Permit2 is never involved and
  there is no window holding loose tokens and no position; the burned NFT is a
  boolean witness that the fire landed, which makes unattended recovery a lookup
  rather than a guess. Authorization does not go through `--confirm`:
  `MandateAuthorization` is keyword-only, is never passed by `main()`, is
  `isinstance`-checked, and refuses to construct once `_ARGV_ENTRY` is set, so
  the CLI cannot build one. Each fire is re-checked against the pinned chainId,
  PositionManager, poolId, tokenId, signer, recipient, slippage floors,
  milestone index, the fixed far edge, a re-derived near edge, and a zero cap on
  the harvested currency. State lives outside the price cache under
  `$AGENTOS_HOME/state/unilp` as a write-ahead log plus a materialized view,
  fsynced and 0600, with `flock` on a separate file. Arming the same position
  twice is now idempotent for identical terms and refused — naming the differing
  field — otherwise; uniqueness is a scan, because `mandate_id` hashes `label`
  and two labels produced two mandates each intending to burn the same NFT.
  Not yet rehearsed on chain: the combined unlock has never been sent against a
  hooked pool, and SKILL.md marks a dust rehearsal as required before the first
  broadcast.
- The Skills page can pin a run to a skill without retyping its name. Each
  installed skill card carries a `Use` button next to `View details`, and the
  detail dialog gains `Use in chat`; both navigate to Chat with the composer
  pre-filled with `use skill <name>\n`, focused with the caret at the end.
  Nothing is sent and the current chat session is kept — the user writes the
  request underneath. The prefill travels as a one-shot `?prompt=` query param
  that ChatPage reads once on mount and `persistSession` strips, so a reload or
  a shared link does not re-inject it; control characters other than newline are
  dropped and the value is truncated at 2000 characters.
- A cron job's ID is visible in the web UI. It was CLI-only despite being the
  handle every `agentos cron …` command takes; it now renders as the first meta
  row on each card, shortened to head+tail, with a copy button for the full
  UUID.

### Fixed

- Cron cards no longer spill over the neighbouring column. A session key like
  `agent:main:telegram:direct:1245463966:new:59f2` has no break opportunity (a
  colon is not one, per UAX-14), so its min-content width equals its full
  rendered width, and three boxes between the grid track and the text — the
  `MotionListItem` grid item, the `<dl>` row, and the `<dd>` flex item — were
  unable to shrink, widening the card box itself before `overflow: hidden` could
  clip anything. All three get `min-width: 0` and the value truncates with an
  ellipsis, keeping the full string in the DOM and on `title` so it stays
  hoverable and greppable. The prompt row wraps instead
  (`overflow-wrap: anywhere`) so an unbroken contract address does not widen the
  card either.
- A cron job storing an unknown tool profile is now rejected at write time
  instead of dying on every firing. `{"profile": "default"}` — no such profile
  exists; `_TOOL_PROFILES` holds coding, full, memory_only, messaging and
  minimal — stored cleanly and then failed ~50 ms into each run, before the
  agent turn started, until the scheduler auto-paused the job after three
  consecutive errors, with no trace but a run record the operator had no reason
  to look at. `normalize_tool_profile` canonicalises the name or raises listing
  the ones that exist, and `SchedulerOps` plus the `cron` RPC call it before
  storing, mirroring how `elevated` is already handled. The read direction stays
  tolerant on purpose: rows carrying a bad profile already exist, and `cron
  list` has to render them or the broken job could not be found and deleted. The
  tool schema now names the valid profiles, since the model that created this
  job had no way to know them.
- A cron job no longer fails forever once the chat it was created from is
  replaced. The web UI stamps `originSessionKey` onto every reminder job while
  forcing its target to `isolated`, and reminder is the default payload kind for
  a new job — so jobs that never asked to be bound to a session still carried
  one. At fire time the delivery chain mirrors the result into that session, and
  the mirror called `append_message`, which raises `KeyError: Session not found`
  for a session that no longer exists. That surfaced as `forward_failed`, and
  because `best_effort` defaults to off — and its checkbox is only rendered for
  channel and webhook delivery, never for the `none` mode this path runs under —
  the run was marked failed with no way to opt out. Both webchat paths are
  covered: the `none`-mode mirror above, and the `mode=ORIGIN` +
  `channel=webchat` config the cron tool synthesises from the live ToolContext
  whenever the agent schedules something mid-conversation — neither destination
  was picked by the operator, so neither should fail a run that already
  succeeded in its own isolated session. They now report a distinct
  `origin_gone` delivery status. The gateway forwarder looks the session up
  before appending and returns `False` when it is gone; forwarders returning
  `None` keep the previous "delivered" contract, and genuine channel delivery
  failures still fail the run. Channel-created jobs (telegram, discord, slack)
  were never affected: their delivery resolves to the chat, which outlives any
  session.

## [2026.8.3] - 2026-08-03

### Changed

- A `pip install use-agent-os` no longer resolves dependencies open-ended.
  Bounds now cover the rest of the base runtime list — `anyio`, `typer`,
  `rich`, `websockets`, `apscheduler`, `prompt-toolkit`, `questionary`,
  `pillow`, the document stack (`pdfplumber`, `pypdf`, `python-docx`,
  `python-pptx`, `openpyxl`, `reportlab`), the extraction stack
  (`beautifulsoup4`, `readability-lxml`), `yoyo-migrations`, `sqlite-vec`,
  `croniter`, `python-telegram-bot` — and the consumer-facing extras
  (`numpy`, `onnxruntime`, `tokenizers`, `tiktoken`, `jieba`, `mem0ai`,
  `weasyprint`), completing the first seven caps from 2026.7.30. A breaking
  major published in any of them can no longer reach a fresh install on its
  own. Each cap sits at the first release its upstream may break in, measured
  from `uv.lock`: the next major for a `>=1.0` project, and the next **minor**
  for a `0.x` one, where semver puts the breaking change. That distinction is
  load-bearing — `typer<1.0` against a locked 0.24.1 reads as bounded and is
  not, and `weasyprint<70.0` against a locked 68.1 was already letting an
  untested 69.0 into fresh installs. Bounds are targeted rather than blanket:
  `structlog` and `html2text` are CalVer, and `pyyaml`/`jinja2`/`cachetools`
  and peers have long-stable surfaces, so capping those would only make
  AgentOS harder to co-install. The rule and its exemptions are written down
  in CONTRIBUTING.md and enforced by
  `tests/test_packaging/test_pyproject_invariants.py`, which recomputes both
  boundaries from the lockfile — so a new dependency cannot ship unbounded, and
  a cap cannot drift off the rule, by accident. `dev` stays uncapped — it is
  contributor tooling pinned by `uv.lock`, not a consumer surface. (#153)

### Added

- Seven GMGN trading skills ship bundled under the **Trading** category on the
  Skills page: `gmgn-token`, `gmgn-market`, `gmgn-portfolio`, `gmgn-track`,
  `gmgn-holder-analysis` (read-only) plus `gmgn-swap` and `gmgn-cooking`
  (financial execution, `risk: high`). They are vendored from
  https://github.com/GMGNAI/gmgn-skills under MIT and drive the third-party
  `gmgn-cli` npm package, which AgentOS does **not** redistribute: each skill
  declares `requires.bins: [gmgn-cli]` and `requires.env: GMGN_API_KEY`, so
  they list as "Needs setup" with an `npm install -g gmgn-cli` hint until an
  operator installs the CLI and supplies their own key. Gated out of the model
  prompt until then, exactly like `senior-unilp-manager`.

### Fixed

- Shipped Pilot Router tier defaults resolved against static tables that had no
  entry for them, and both tables fail open without logging: pricing falls
  through a `startswith` scan to whatever shorter prefix matches first (or a
  generic $3/$15), the catalog falls through an exact-key miss to a generic
  200K context / 16K output. `glm-4.7-flashx` was estimating at the generic
  default, and seven ids — including `anthropic/claude-opus-5`, the OpenRouter
  c3 default, whose bare spelling was listed at 1M/128K — were sizing turns
  against generic limits. Every tier default now carries an explicit entry in
  both tables, enforced by a test that walks all router tier profiles.
- OpenCAP cost estimates silently used a different gateway's rate sheet after a
  single failed boot fetch. The price cache was seeded exactly once, only when
  the configured provider was OpenCAP, and never refreshed — so one timeout
  meant every estimate for the life of the process came from the shared static
  table, which carries Bankr rates running 3-5x below OpenCAP's own. The cache
  now refreshes on a TTL and refetches when it is cold, mirroring the existing
  OpenRouter live-pricing path, with a shorter negative cache so an unreachable
  catalog costs one bounded attempt rather than one per lookup. When an
  estimate does fall back to the static table it is logged once per model, so a
  substituted number is no longer indistinguishable from a catalog-backed one.
  Set `AGENTOS_OPENCAP_LIVE_PRICING=0` to disable the refresh.
- Asked to install a bundled skill that was only unconfigured, the agent
  searched a community hub instead. A skill declaring `requires` is dropped
  from the prompt until its binary and variables are present, so from inside a
  turn an installed-but-unconfigured skill is indistinguishable from one that
  was never installed — and a same-named catalog row installs into the managed
  layer, which outranks bundled and would have silently replaced the shipped
  skill for every session. Three changes close that path: the installer now
  refuses a first install that would shadow a bundled skill (overridable with
  `force`, and never blocking a reinstall or `agentos skills update` of an
  existing one); `skill_search_community` answers with an `installed_match`
  block, carrying what the local skill is missing and how to fix it, ahead of
  the catalog results; and the `agentos` skill documents both rules.
- `skill_view(name="agentos", section="Skills")` failed even though the skill
  documents skills at length — the material sat under bold labels, which
  `parse_sections` does not index. The six operation groups under **Common
  operations** are real headings now, so each can be read on its own.
- `agentos upgrade` shipped a stale React control UI on any install laid down
  from a local checkout. `scripts/install_source.sh` installs the directory
  itself, so uv's tool receipt records a *directory* requirement; `uv tool
  upgrade` then re-resolved that requirement and rebuilt the wheel from the
  working tree. The wheel bundles `src/agentos/gateway/static/dist/**`, but
  nothing in the upgrade path runs `npm run build` — so every upgrade
  re-packaged whatever browser bundle happened to be on disk. Python code moved
  forward, the web UI did not. `agentos upgrade` now installs the published
  release (`uv tool install --force --python <running> "use-agent-os[recommended]"`
  / `pipx install --force …`), whose wheel carries a control UI built and
  verified in CI. Installing a checkout stays with `scripts/install_source.sh`,
  the only path that rebuilds the bundle first; the command names it when it
  detects a checkout-backed install.
- `agentos upgrade` printed upgrade commands with the extras silently removed —
  Rich parsed the `[recommended]` in `use-agent-os[recommended]` as a markup
  tag and dropped it, so copying the printed command produced an install
  missing the ONNX embedding models and the pilot router.

### Security

- Durable memory ran its own three-pattern redaction rather than the shared
  scanner, so anything the small list missed was written to disk verbatim.
  `redact_memory_text` now goes through `redact_sensitive_text` — the full
  provider-prefix set — and does so with `force=True`, because
  `AGENTOS_REDACT_SECRETS=0` is an *egress* escape hatch and must not unmask
  what lands in durable storage. The keyword rule (`api_key`, `secret`,
  `token`, `password`) handles quoted values and leaves already-masked text
  alone instead of double-redacting it. The shared scanner also learned the
  remaining AWS key-id prefixes (`ASIA` temporary credentials, `ABIA`, `ACCA`)
  and now matches `Authorization` and `x-api-key`-family headers when the name
  or value is quoted — the JSON and dict spellings a tool result actually
  arrives in, which the bare `name: value` patterns walked past.

## [2026.8.2.post1] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- The release wheel guard allowed markdown only at a bundled skill's `SKILL.md`
  plus two force-included pptx references, so `senior-unilp-manager`'s
  `assets/v4-reference.md` read as a forbidden entry and the tagged Windows
  release job failed for v2026.8.2 — after the tag had already been pushed.
  `assets/` is where that documentation is supposed to live, and `SKILL.md`
  links it by `{baseDir}`, so stripping it shipped instructions pointing at a
  file that is not on disk. `agentos/skills/bundled/<skill>/assets/**` is now
  allowed; `references/` and stray top-level markdown stay forbidden. A
  real-tree test over the bundled skills fails PR CI instead of the tagged
  release job.
- Cron prompt safety rejected legitimate text: Unicode combining marks (used by
  Vietnamese and many other scripts) were treated as invisible characters and
  blocked. Combining marks are allowed again, while genuinely invisible marks
  stay blocked.

## [2026.8.2] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- A cron job may opt in to running shell-based skills. A cron turn runs under a
  read-only allowlist with `exec_command` hard-denied, so a job that was shown a
  skill could read its `SKILL.md` and never carry it out — nearly every skill
  body is a block of shell. Per-job `tool_policy` could not help, because the
  policy layer re-ORs the hard-denied set at the end and the elevated clamp
  excluded cron outright. The opt-in is stored as `tool_policy["elevated"] =
  "bypass" | "full"` on the column that already persists, so there is no
  migration and it inherits the "channel callers cannot set tool_policy"
  invariant. An opted-in job additionally gets `exec_command`, `write_file` and
  `edit_file`; `cron`, `message`, `agents_list`, subagents,
  `background_process`, `execute_code`, `apply_patch` and `git_commit` stay
  denied, and `"on"` is rejected because it skips the sandbox with no branch in
  the exec approval path. Elevation is refused on non-`agent_run` jobs, since
  the heartbeat loop builds its own read-only context and would silently drop
  it. Surfaced on RPC (top-level `elevated`), the CLI (`--elevated`,
  `--elevated-mode`, `--tool-policy`, plus a list column) and the Web UI (a
  warned toggle and a badge on the job card). Default cron routing is unchanged
  (#184).

- The `senior-unilp-manager` skill can now find and mint into Uniswap v4 pools
  that have **no hook**. It only ever LPs into pools that already exist, and it
  refuses hooked pools unless `--allow-hooked` — so hook-less was always the
  intended default, but on Base it was effectively unreachable: the only fast
  discovery path derived poolIds from a launchpad registry, which by
  construction requires a hook, and Base cannot serve the log scan that would
  find anything else. `pools --token <addr> --no-hook` now derives the poolId
  with `hooks` pinned to the zero address across the conventional fee tiers and
  confirms it in one multicall, so the question "does a plain pool exist for
  this token?" is answered the same way on every chain. `pool`/`mint` accept the
  PoolKey spelled out (`--currency0 --currency1 --fee --tick-spacing`,
  `--hooks` defaulting to none), which skips discovery altogether for any pool
  anywhere; the poolId is recomputed and must match, so a typo errors instead of
  addressing the wrong pool. The skill still never creates a pool.

- `[auxiliary]` configures the model for work AgentOS runs on its own behalf
  rather than as part of a turn — analysing an attached document, describing an
  image. Empty values reuse `[llm]`, so an install that never sets it is
  unchanged; point it at something cheap when those tasks do not need your main
  model. Per-task overrides live in `[auxiliary.tasks.<task>]` (`document` and
  `vision` today), because a text-only model cannot describe an image.

- The system prompt now names the developer tools that actually exist on the
  machine. An agent asked to run the tests reached for `pytest` and found out it
  was missing by running it and reading a shell error, which cost a turn and
  often started a repair for a problem that was never the task. The block is
  probed once per process and lives in the cached part of the prompt, so it is
  paid for once per session rather than once per turn. Only names are emitted,
  never paths. Turn it off with `[prompt] env_probe_enabled = false`.

- `agentos context` shows what every provider request carries before the
  conversation starts. Tool schemas dominate that overhead — about 7,300 tokens
  on a stock install, charged on every call in every turn — and nothing
  surfaced the number, so the only way to learn it was to write a script
  against the registry. The command breaks the cost down, lists the largest
  schemas, and prices each `[tools] profile` against the current one.

- `[tools] profile` is now documented. It already narrowed the tool surface
  sharply — `coding` costs 77% less than `full`, `messaging` 92% less — but it
  appeared in no example config, no doc page and no operator guide, so the
  largest available lever on per-request cost was undiscoverable. Because a
  profile is fixed for the session, narrowing it does not disturb the prompt
  cache.

- A turn that edits code and then answers "done" without running anything is
  now noticed. A passive ledger records which files a turn changed and whether
  a test, build or lint command ran *after* the last change; when the model
  stops on unverified edits the turn emits a warning naming the files and the
  omission. Evidence gathered before an edit does not count for it. Prose,
  data and config files are excluded — a README edit has nothing a test could
  exercise — and messaging surfaces are exempt, since answering a person in
  chat is not maintaining a checkout.

- New bundled skill `senior-unilp-manager`: read and manage Uniswap V4 liquidity
  on Base (8453) and Robinhood Chain (4663). Reads a token's pools with exact
  reserves and per-range market-cap bands, resolves which launchpad deployed a
  token and whether its LP is locked (Clanker v4/v4.1, Liquid Protocol,
  Bankr/Doppler), inspects positions, and mints / increases / decreases /
  collects / burns. Pure Python 3 stdlib over direct JSON-RPC — keccak256, the
  ABI codec, Multicall3, secp256k1 and EIP-1559 assembly are all in-tree, so the
  skill has no dependency beyond a `python3` binary. Every write is a dry run
  that prints a `PLAN_HASH`; broadcasting requires echoing that hash back with
  `--broadcast --confirm`, and the signature is recovered and checked against the
  signer before the transaction is sent. The signing key is read from
  `UNIV4_LP_PRIVATE_KEY` in the environment and never from a command line.
  `python3 scripts/selftest.py` runs 429 offline assertions pinned to golden
  vectors harvested from the reference implementation.

- Skill manifests may declare `metadata.agentos.category`, a subject-matter tag
  distinct from `capabilities` (which describes risk surface, not topic). The
  Skills page uses it to split shipped skills into their own headings, so a new
  crypto skill only has to edit its own frontmatter.

### Changed

- `edit_file` no longer fails on text that differs from the file only in
  formatting. It still tries an exact match first, then falls back through a
  chain of increasingly permissive strategies — indentation, whitespace runs,
  unescaped `\n` literals, smart quotes, and finally block similarity — and
  names the strategy that matched in its result. Text that appears more than
  once is still rejected rather than guessed, now with the line numbers of
  every match, and a failed edit reports the closest regions it found.

- The progress watchdog now sees repeated *successful* calls, not only repeated
  failures. An agent reading the same file over and over produced a clean result
  every time, so by every measure the turn was making progress while burning
  iterations and context on nothing. A call is counted as a repeat only when its
  result is byte-identical to the previous one for the same tool and arguments —
  re-reading a file that changed is real work, and its differing result resets
  the count.

- The Skills page renames two group headings and adds one: `Partners` →
  **Partner Skills**, `Shipped with AgentOS` → **AgentOS Normal Skills**, and a
  new **AgentOS Crypto Skills** between them for bundled skills declaring
  `category: crypto`. Partner skills still win over every other grouping, and a
  local or hub-installed skill cannot move itself under an AgentOS-branded
  heading by declaring the category.

### Fixed

- `senior-unilp-manager`'s confirm gate could be passed with calldata the
  reviewer never saw. The gate spans two processes — a dry run prints a
  `PLAN_HASH`, a human approves it, a second invocation broadcasts with
  `--confirm` — so any flag that reaches the calldata without reaching the hash
  could be swapped in between. Four did: `increase --recipient` fed the sweep
  action while being neither hashed nor displayed, `approve --expiration-days`
  set the Permit2 expiration outside a hash that covered only token and amount,
  `mint --max-tick-drift` could be widened at broadcast to disable the
  re-validation it was approved with, and the deadline *offset* was free to
  change. Every calldata-affecting flag is now bound into the hash. The
  absolute deadline stays out on purpose, so a re-run minutes later still
  matches. New tests mutate one flag at a time across all six subcommands and
  require a different hash, and hold each command to a frozen field set.

- A cron `update` that changed `enabled` alongside other fields discarded the
  rest of the patch. The enabled branch returned right after pause/resume, and
  the Web UI's save always carries `enabled` — so saving a paused job dropped
  its name, text, schedule, timezone and delivery with no error. The transition
  now applies and processing continues, and `enabled` enters the patch so
  `job.enabled` tracks the status, which is what Resume on an auto-disabled job
  needs to take effect.

- The "Set &lt;VAR&gt;" dialog on the Skills page rendered its value field with a
  class that was never defined, so the input fell back to user-agent styling and
  was indistinguishable from the dark panel behind it — the field looked absent.

- Six fixes to the `/control/skills` surface. A wallet-published skill reaches
  the Bankr source only by being named in a wheel-shipped allowlist reviewed in
  this repo, which is the same review path a catalog entry gets, so it now
  groups with Bankr and shows the brand mark on the Installed tab; the provider
  is hardcoded rather than read from the payload, so a hostile registry row
  cannot mint a brand for itself, and the author handle rides along as credit
  and stays searchable. The Bankr and Capminal panels name the prerequisite
  skill each catalog needs, and Capminal infers its category from tags instead
  of hardcoding `crypto`. On status: "No requirements" is gone, since a skill
  with no declared dependencies runs exactly like one whose dependencies are
  satisfied — both are Ready, with the nuance in the tooltip — and Disabled gets
  its own grey bucket instead of showing as "Needs setup" and sending operators
  hunting a dependency that was never missing. A payload without an explicit
  status no longer vanishes from every filter, and a blank or whitespace-only
  env var counts as missing rather than reporting Ready until it fails at
  runtime.

- The packaging test that checks skill docs for links the wheel strips built its
  paths with `str()`, which emits backslashes on Windows, while both things it
  compares against spell those paths with forward slashes. Nothing matched on
  `windows-latest`: force-included files were never skipped and every known
  stranded reference read as newly stranded. Paths are compared as posix now.

- `senior-unilp-manager` sent an agent round in circles on "add N of my token as LP
  from the current price up to a market cap of X" — one real run spent twelve minutes
  and forty commands without reaching a mint. Several things compounded, all fixed
  here. **§8 documented the single-sided rule backwards** (it claimed a range above the
  current price takes `currency1`; it takes `currency0`), so the agent picked the wrong
  side, was refused, assumed it had the wrong pool, and went looking for another one.
  **A hook was treated as disqualifying**: the docs only noted that Clanker/Liquid
  reject third-party LPs, so the Doppler pool — the only one with real depth — was
  abandoned for dust pools at 85% fee tiers; §8 now gives the per-hook policy and says
  to read the decoded `BEFORE_ADD_LIQUIDITY` flag. **`ticks` snapped outward
  unconditionally**, so a band starting at today's price always straddled the current
  tick and came back two-sided; `--from-current` now pulls the near edge onto one side,
  keeping the larger part of the band. `--mcap-lower` / `--mcap-upper` may be given in
  either order rather than erroring, since which is larger depends on where the target
  sits. `pools` ends with a `recommended pool` block — deepest by TVL, id in full,
  whether `--allow-hooked` is needed, and the next command. Part B opens with a
  five-command recipe covering the `approve` step, which the agent kept skipping.

- `senior-unilp-manager` lost USD prices to rate limiting far too easily, and `ticks`
  turned that into a hard failure. GeckoTerminal's free endpoint refuses after a couple
  of calls in quick succession, and since every command is a fresh process the
  in-memory cache never helped — running `pools` and then `ticks` on what it found was
  enough to trip it. Prices are now cached to a short-lived file shared across
  processes, and a throttled lookup says it is temporary and worth retrying instead of
  reporting "no USD price", which read as a property of the token and sent callers off
  to look at other pools.

- A turn could die with `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable` partway
  through a streaming reply, taking the whole answer with it. The OpenAI-compat
  stream reader read `choices`, `delta`, `tool_calls` and each tool call's
  `function` with a `dict.get(key, default)` — but that default only applies
  when the key is *absent*, and several gateways send the key with an explicit
  `null` instead of omitting it (a text-only delta carrying `"tool_calls":
  null`, or a usage-only final chunk carrying `"choices": null`). Those reads
  now treat null and missing identically, so a chunk shaped that way is skipped
  rather than crashing the turn. The non-streaming path read `choices` the same
  way and is fixed alongside it.

- Tool schemas from MCP servers went to the provider exactly as the server
  emitted them, so one malformed tool could fail the whole request and take
  every other tool down with it. Schemas are now normalized once at discovery:
  `$ref` into `$defs` is inlined, `anyOf`/`oneOf` unions that exist only to
  permit `null` collapse to their concrete branch, `"type": ["string", "null"]`
  becomes `"string"`, objects without `properties` gain an empty one, and
  values that are not schemas at all are dropped along with any `required`
  entry naming them.

- Side-task LLM calls spent tokens that nothing recorded. Analysing a document
  and describing an image each built their own provider client, so the cost
  appeared on the provider bill but never in `agentos cost`. Those calls now run
  through one auxiliary client that bills the session that triggered them and
  additionally records them under an `aux:<task>` scope, keeping runtime cost
  separable from turn cost. Two copies of the provider-to-credential mapping in
  `tools/builtin/media.py` collapse into one — the document path had only ever
  read the environment, so it ignored a key configured in `[llm]` for the same
  provider and now finds it.

- A side task with no reachable API key sent the request anyway and failed on
  `Illegal header value b'Bearer '`, which named neither the provider nor the
  variable to set. It now fails before the request with both. Local backends
  such as Ollama, which authenticate by reachability rather than by key, are
  unaffected.

- A failing provider request read its error body whole. That body is written by
  whatever sits in front of the provider — a WAF's HTML block page, a proxy's
  stack trace — and has no size contract, so the read was unbounded; on the
  Anthropic path the entire decoded body then became the `ErrorEvent` message
  and flowed into the agent's context. Error bodies are now read to a bound and
  summarised: JSON keeps its `error.message`, an HTML page collapses to its
  title and size, and anything else is truncated with the cut made visible.

- `skill_view` now resolves `{baseDir}` to the skill's install directory and
  opens every read with a `[Skill directory: ...]` line. The placeholder is how
  every bundled skill names its own scripts, but nothing had ever expanded it and
  nothing else in a session revealed where a skill lived — so an agent handed
  `python3 {baseDir}/scripts/lp_read.py` looked for that path under the
  workspace, found nothing, and reported the skill as not installed. Expansion
  happens at render time, not at load: `skill_edit` writes `SkillSpec.content`
  back to disk, and expanding earlier would bake one machine's absolute path
  into a shipped `SKILL.md`.

- The Skill dialog rendered `[object Object]` for every declared environment
  variable. `_requirements_item` put `SkillRequires.env` on the wire, which is a
  list of `SkillEnvVar` dataclasses, instead of `env_names`. No bundled skill had
  declared `requires.env` before now, so nothing had hit it.

## [2026.7.31] - 2026-07-31

### Changed

- Onboarding router tier defaults move up a generation across all three
  gateway profiles (`openrouter`, `bankr`, `opencap`): C1 goes from
  `minimax-m3` to `gpt-5.6-luna` and C3 from `claude-opus-4.8` to
  `claude-opus-5`. On the OpenRouter profile C0 moves to
  `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` so C0 and C1 do not collapse onto the same
  model and the cheap tier keeps its purpose. `claude-opus-5` is registered
  in the model catalog and pricing tables, so its context window is 1M rather
  than the 200K default and the usage tracker reports real cost.
  `minimax-m3` stays as the `image_model` vision route and is deliberately
  left out of the migration maps, which apply to every tier including
  `image_model` (#169).

- The Pilot Router docs now describe the C0–C3 tiers — what each tier is for,
  which model each gateway profile assigns to it, and how to pick one — and
  the OpenCAP routing page no longer mentions `oc-uncensored-1.0` (#170).

### Fixed

- Any skill that called an authenticated HTTP API was dead on arrival. The
  outbound guard matched credential-ish *names*, so `http_request` refused
  every `Authorization` and `x-api-key` header, and `exec_command` refused
  `{"sellToken": …}` (a web3 asset, not a token), `grep "token: "`, and
  `CAP_API_KEY=$(jq -r …)` — while a real key pasted inline passed through.
  With no working call path and no approval route, the model routed around it
  by writing the key to a file and running that, which the guard never
  inspected (#165).

  The guard now matches credential **values** — a PEM block, a
  vendor-prefixed provider key, a DSN password, an `/etc/passwd` line — and
  leaves names alone. An opaque API key in a header is how authenticated APIs
  work and is no longer refused. The shell check runs only on commands that
  can reach the network, mirroring the gate `execute_code` already applied.
  Blocks now name a working alternative instead of dead-ending, and
  `AGENTOS_SENSITIVE_PAYLOAD_DISABLED=1` turns the check off.

  What replaces the pattern match is a credential path: a skill declares
  `metadata.requires.env`, and those names — and only those — are forwarded
  into `execute_code`'s sandbox for the session that loaded the skill, so the
  value never enters the transcript. A skill AgentOS did not ship cannot
  declare one of AgentOS's own provider keys.

### Added

- Command output is scanned for credentials before it reaches the model.
  `exec_command`, `background_process` and `process(action=log)` mask
  vendor-shaped keys, auth headers, JWTs, private keys and DSN passwords.
  File content gets a non-reusable sentinel rather than a head/tail mask, so
  an agent that reads a key and writes it back cannot silently corrupt it.
  `AGENTOS_REDACT_SECRETS=0` disables it; the value is read once at startup so
  a command cannot switch it off mid-session.

- `AGENTOS_STRIP_PROVIDER_ENV=1` withholds AgentOS's provider credentials from
  child processes. Off by default because bundled skills read those names from
  `os.environ`.

### Security

- `AGENTOS_GATEWAY_TOKEN` and the sandbox guard switches no longer reach
  child processes. Every `exec_command` previously inherited `os.environ`
  verbatim, including the token that authenticates to the control plane.

- `http_request` now refuses cloud metadata endpoints (`169.254.169.254`,
  `metadata.google.internal`, ECS task credentials). The repo already shipped
  an SSRF guard and `web_fetch` used it, but `http_request` validated only the
  URL scheme. Ordinary private addresses stay reachable — unlike `web_fetch`,
  this is the tool people point at a local dev server on purpose.

## [2026.7.30] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Native support for Capminal Skills (`Capminal/agent-skills`) in the Skills
  hub: browse, inspect, and install allowlisted Capminal skills with publisher
  branding, carried by a Capminal brand mark that falls back cleanly when the
  logo cannot be fetched (#144).

### Changed

- Runtime dependencies in `pyproject.toml` now carry upper bounds, so a major
  release of a dependency cannot land in an install that was resolved against
  the previous one (#153).

### Fixed

- The agent could not tell which of its installed skills applied to a request,
  and answered from general knowledge instead. Four separate causes, each of
  which alone was enough to produce that:

  - The prompt budget was a cliff. One skill over it and *every* description in
    the block was dropped for a name-only list — a 27k render fell to 3.5k
    against a 24k budget, so 20k of the configured allowance bought nothing and
    the model had never seen a single description. Descriptions are now
    shortened to the longest length that fits (the widest, not the first that
    works: 451 chars where a fixed step would have settled for 320), and skills
    are only dropped once even a names-only list overruns. A default install
    was unaffected; the cliff was reached by installing skills, which is
    backwards.
  - Names-only mode told the model to call `skill_view` on every entry that
    might be relevant — up to one call per skill, which no model will do — and
    never mentioned `skill_list`, which returns every description in one call.
    It now points at `skill_list`, and only when the session actually has it.
  - With prompt caching on (the default), the block was delivered as a *user*
    message headed "not a user request … use it only when it is relevant",
    contradicting its own "read this before answering" from the weakest
    position in the request. When the skill list is the same every turn
    (relevance filtering off, the default) it now belongs to the cacheable
    system prompt instead, which is also where it is cheapest.
  - Scheduled (cron) turns received the block but not `skill_view` or
    `skill_list`, so following it was impossible. Both tools — read-only — are
    now on the cron allowlist.

- Asking for a skill that is not installed read as a broken tool. `skill_view`
  answered with what *not* to do and "tell the user the skill is not installed",
  offering no next step even when a configured hub carries the skill and the
  tools to fetch it are in the session — so a model dressed the dead end up as a
  failure, reporting that `skill_view` "returned error: 14", a code that exists
  nowhere in AgentOS. It now says the lookup worked and the skill simply is not
  here, names installed skills with similar names, and points at
  `skill_search_community` — only when the session can actually reach it, and
  always as an offer to install rather than an instruction to (#162).

- Reading a large skill cost the whole skill. `skill_view` returned every byte
  of a SKILL.md, and unlike the system prompt a tool result is not cached, so a
  56 000-character hub skill spent ~14 000 tokens per read and again on every
  re-read — the shape behind reports of skill loading being slow and expensive.
  Over `[skills].max_skill_view_chars` (new, default 10 000) it now returns the
  skill's opening sections plus an index of the rest, read on with
  `skill_view(name, section="<title>")`. Across the skills on a real install
  that is 43% fewer characters, and 80–87% on the largest. Shipped skills are
  unaffected: the largest is 21 600 characters and the median 2 400. A body with
  no headings, or one only slightly over the ceiling where the index would cost
  more than it saves, is still returned whole.

- A skills block that quietly lost its descriptions was indistinguishable from
  an operator uninstalling skills: nothing was reported as dropped and the
  character count simply fell. Each turn now records `skills_render_mode` and
  `skills_description_max_chars` in the decision log, and any render below
  `full` is logged as `skills_filter.budget_degraded` with what to change.

- A skill's linked files were named with the platform separator, so on Windows
  the index offered `references\api.md`. A model quotes that back as
  `file_path`, where the backslash is a JSON escape, and it matches neither the
  tool call nor how a `SKILL.md` writes its own links. Paths are emitted as
  POSIX now. Nothing was unreadable — the reader already normalised separators;
  the defect was in what the agent was told to type.

- Skill cards in the Web UI overflowed their grid tracks and changed height
  with their content, so the hub grid reflowed as cards loaded. The card layout
  is fixed now and long text is contained rather than pushing the track wider
  (#135, #161).

- The **Installed** chip in the skill detail dialog did not reflect whether the
  skill was actually installed (#121).

## [2026.7.29] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Bankr skills published from bankr.bot — the ones that live under an author's
  wallet address instead of in the `BankrBot/skills` repository — can now be
  browsed and installed like any other hub skill, starting with
  `stock-premium-lp-manager`. They arrive as JSON with the body inline, so the
  `SKILL.md` is synthesized from the payload rather than downloaded from a
  repository, and the skill is credited to its author rather than inheriting
  Bankr's brand. As with the repository half, only allowlisted skills can be
  installed through the Bankr source, so it cannot be used to pull an arbitrary
  author's skill and record it as having come from Bankr's hub.

### Security

- `SECURITY.md` now answers what happens to an audit report: findings go
  through the private advisory form rather than a pull request adding an audit
  document to the repository, there is no bug bounty program, and a researcher
  whose report leads to a fix is credited in that fix's release notes (#154).

## [2026.7.28] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- A new chat can be started from anywhere in the console with
  `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+O`, using the same flow as the New Chat button. The button
  tooltip shows the platform-appropriate hint (#131, closes #120).

### Fixed

- The settings screen called itself three different things depending on where
  you looked. The route title, sidebar item, page heading, browser tab title,
  and the docs now all say **Agent Setup** (#125, closes #123).

## [2026.7.27] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- A variable reported as missing is now checked against the places a
  credential may already live. If `gh auth login` has been run, `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  is reported as available from the GitHub CLI and can be imported with
  `agentos env import GITHUB_TOKEN` or a button on the Environment screen.
  Checking runs `gh auth status`, never `gh auth token`, so nothing reads a
  secret to decide whether one exists; importing only happens when asked for.
- When a skill's requirements are unmet, `skill_view` appends a setup note
  saying what is missing and what to do about it — and what to do depends on
  who is listening. A chat channel is told a secret must not be collected
  there because it would be stored in the conversation; an unattended run is
  told to continue and state what does not work; an interactive session gets
  the actual command. The skill still loads either way.
- Environment variables can be managed from AgentOS instead of by hand-editing
  `~/.agentos/.env` and restarting. Every surface that could already *detect* a
  missing variable can now *fix* it: a new **Environment** screen in the Web UI
  (`/env`), an `agentos env list|get|set|unset` command, `env.*` gateway RPC,
  and a **Set &lt;VAR&gt;** action in the Skills dialog next to the existing
  install action. Setting a variable applies it to the running gateway, so a
  skill that was ineligible for want of one becomes eligible without a restart.
- Skill manifests can describe the variables they need — a description, where
  to obtain the value, and whether it is a secret — instead of only naming
  them. Existing manifests using the plain `requires.env: [NAME]` list keep
  working unchanged.
- Skills can also declare non-secret settings under `metadata.agentos.config`,
  stored in the TOML config under `[skills.config]` rather than in `.env`.
  Their current values are appended to what `skill_view` returns, so the agent
  starts from what is configured instead of asking.
- The agent has `env_list` (names and set/unset state, never values) and, gated
  behind the approval queue and hidden by default, `env_set`. There is no
  reveal tool: a model that can read back stored credentials is one prompt
  injection away from exfiltrating them.
- "Is the agent actually being offered this skill?" is now a question with an
  answer. Every skill row from the gateway, and every line the agent's own
  skill listing prints, carries whether the skill is offered and — when it is
  not — which of six reasons applies: model invocation is disabled in its
  manifest, a requirement is missing, a tool it needs is not enabled in this
  session, a native tool supersedes it as a fallback, relevance filtering
  skipped it for this message, or the injected skills block was full. The
  explanation is one sentence naming what to do, and it never contains a
  filesystem path. Ready and offered were previously the same green dot, which
  is why a perfectly installed skill could sit there being silently withheld.
  Five of the six answer from the installed set alone, so the Skills page shows
  them before you send anything; only the relevance-filtering one needs a
  message to rank against and stays in the decision log.
- With `[tools] enabled = false`, skills that require a tool are now reported as
  withheld rather than available. The Skills page previously answered against
  everything the install could offer while chat answered against a turn with no
  tools at all — the same skill, two answers.
- How a skill was acquired — `shipped` with AgentOS, installed from a `hub`, or
  a `local` directory you added — is now a fact AgentOS records and reports,
  alongside the source, identifier, version, and install time for hub installs.
  It is derived from the install record rather than guessed from which
  directory the files sit in, so moving a skill does not change the story of
  where it came from.
- The same record answers whether Update and Remove will actually work. A
  hub-installed skill whose files no longer sit where the lockfile recorded
  them keeps Update — an update re-fetches by identifier — and loses Remove,
  because AgentOS will not delete files it cannot prove it owns. The Web UI
  says so instead of offering a button that fails.
- Skills can name a publisher, so a partner's skills carry that partner's
  identity whether they shipped with AgentOS or you installed them from that
  partner's hub. Publishers are allowlisted **inside AgentOS**: a `SKILL.md` or
  a hub catalog can only *select* a recognized publisher by id, never describe
  one. A third-party skill that writes a partner's name, URL, and logo into its
  own frontmatter renders as an ordinary unbranded skill. Selecting an id is
  restricted too: only a skill shipping inside the release may name its own
  publisher, and an installed one is branded by the hub catalog row it came
  from, so a directory dropped into a skills path can never appear as a
  partner. Publisher is independent of provenance — one says whose name is on a
  skill, the other where the text came from and under what licence.
- `agentos skills list --json` gained `publisher` and `acquisition`, built by
  the same code the gateway and the Web UI use. It deliberately has no
  `availability` key: that depends on a chat session's tool surface, which a
  CLI process does not have, and an absent key means "not computed" rather than
  "not offered".

### Changed

- The Skills screen's Installed tab now groups cards by where a skill came
  from — **Partners**, **Shipped with AgentOS**, **Installed from a hub**,
  **Your local skills** — instead of by which directory holds the files. The
  storage layer is still shown, as a chip on each card, because it decides
  which skill wins a name collision; it no longer decides the heading. If you
  navigated by the old `Bundled` / `Managed` headings, the cards under them are
  now under `Shipped with AgentOS` and `Installed from a hub`.
- `skills.max_skills_prompt_chars` now defaults to **24000**, up from 8000. The
  bundled skill set renders to about 16k characters with descriptions, so the
  old default silently forced every default install past the budget and into
  name-only mode — the model had never seen a skill description on a stock
  install. Raise it further if you install many skills; lower it if you run a
  model with a small context window, where the whole-request ceiling can be
  smaller than this budget. See
  [configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#skill-prompt-budget).

### Security

- Environment writes are refused for names that steer subprocess execution
  (`PATH`, `LD_PRELOAD`, `PYTHONPATH`, `EDITOR`, …) or AgentOS runtime posture
  (`AGENTOS_AGENT_PERMISSIONS`, `AGENTOS_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, `AGENTOS_STATE_DIR`,
  …). Every tool AgentOS spawns inherits `os.environ` and several guards are
  read from it, so a writable surface without this gate could widen what the
  agent is allowed to do. The gate applies on write only — values set in your
  shell or by editing the file directly keep working, and the `AGENTOS_` prefix
  is not blanket-blocked.
- Listings never carry a value. `env.reveal` is a separate method, rate limited
  to five per thirty seconds and written to the audit log.
- The Hermes migration wrote the migrated `.env` at the default umask, leaving
  imported credentials world-readable on a typical box. It now writes `0600`,
  like every other `.env` AgentOS creates.

### Upgrade notes

- Two `.env` lines that AgentOS previously ignored now take effect: a
  bash-style `export KEY=value`, and the first entry in a file saved with a
  byte-order mark. Both were parsed into unusable keys before (literally
  `export KEY`, and `\ufeffKEY`), so the variable was not set. If your `.env`
  has either, expect that variable to start being applied — which is what the
  line was written to do. Values exported in your shell still win over the
  file, so nothing that was already working changes.
- CLI logs now go to stderr instead of stdout. Anything capturing a command's
  stdout to collect log output needs `2>` instead; in exchange, `--json`
  output is parseable on an install that has a populated `.env`.
- The skill snapshot cache is invalidated once on first run, so the first
  command after upgrading rescans skills from disk.

### Removed

- The session-flush subsystem is gone. It wrote a "flush receipt" before
  destructive compaction and never earned its keep: roughly 8,000 lines for a
  memory path that underperformed. Compaction still records a durable
  checkpoint first, so the pre-image it recovers from is unchanged.
- The `memory.flush_*` and `memory.repair_*` configuration keys are no longer
  read. An existing `agentos.toml` keeps working — the keys are dropped on load
  with one warning naming them, and the file is rewritten on the next config
  save. They will be rejected outright in 0.2.0.

  Removing `memory.flush_enabled`, `memory.flush_compaction_safety_mode`, and
  `memory.flush_compaction_requires_safe_receipt` matters most. With no flush
  service left, no receipt can ever be written, so `flush_enabled = true`
  combined with `block` (or the legacy `requires_safe_receipt`) would have made
  compaction demand a receipt nothing could produce: refused on every turn,
  context window filling until the provider errors, with a single warning line
  as the only clue.
- `sessions.reset` and `sessions.contextCompact` no longer return a
  `flush_receipt` field, and `agentos reset` no longer prints a "Flush mode"
  line. Both described work that no longer happens.

### Fixed

- `env_key` is not always a variable name: providers that authenticate by
  OAuth carry the literal string `"OAuth"`, which put a variable called
  `OAuth` on the Environment screen that nobody could set.
- `skill_list` no longer tells the model to call `env_set`, which is hidden by
  default and so usually not callable — the same dead-end this feature exists
  to remove.
- A `.env` value with significant leading or trailing whitespace was written
  unquoted and then silently trimmed when read back. The OpenClaw migration
  carries a command allowlist across, and its entries are prefix patterns:
  `"^pytest "` with the trailing space matches that command, while `"^pytest"`
  without it matches anything starting with those six characters. Migrating an
  allowlist and quietly widening it is the wrong direction.
- `.env` parsing now recognises the bash-compatible `export KEY=value` form.
  A hand-written `export GITHUB_TOKEN=…` was previously invisible to AgentOS,
  and a save would have appended a second, competing definition.
- `/reset` in the standalone chat TUI works again on sessions with a non-empty
  transcript. It had been gated on a flush service that is never constructed,
  so it aborted every time; `/compact` printed a matching false warning.
- The skills block no longer writes an absolute filesystem path for every
  skill into the system prompt. Nothing read it — skills are looked up by name,
  and the skill-reading tool explicitly tells the model not to go looking on
  disk — while it accounted for roughly two thirds of the block and put the
  user's home directory in front of the model on every turn. Removing it, with
  the raised budget above, is what lets a stock install list every skill with
  its description.
- Upgrading lifts an existing `skills.max_skills_prompt_chars = 8000` to the new
  default. The key is materialised into every saved `config.toml`, so raising the
  default alone would have reached new installs only, and 8000 is exactly the
  value that cannot fit the shipped skills' descriptions. The rewrite runs with
  the config migrations on the next gateway start, takes the usual timestamped
  backup, and touches only that exact old default — a budget someone chose is
  left alone.
- A skill that appears in a skills directory while the gateway is running is
  now picked up on the next turn instead of at the next restart. The cache was
  only cleared through AgentOS's own install paths, but the directories are
  shared: `agentos skills install` runs in a separate process, and
  `~/.agents/skills` is written to by other agents on the same machine. A skill
  from either was on disk, absent from `skills.list`, absent from the prompt,
  and unmentioned in any log. The cache is now validated against the same
  file manifest the on-disk snapshot already used, which costs one stat sweep —
  measured at 0.6 ms for 65 skills — on each load.
- `~/.agents/skills` and `<project>/.agents/skills` are honoured when they are
  created after startup. Both resolved once at boot and a missing one collapsed
  to "no such layer", so the first cross-agent install on a machine stayed
  invisible until a restart. The managed directory was already exempt for this
  exact reason; these two now match it.
- The guidance above the skills list no longer argues against using it. It
  opened with "Skills are optional task playbooks" and told the model to load
  one "only when a listed entry clearly matches" — while the same block, in the
  compact mode a stock install always fell into, listed nothing but names. A
  bare name matches nothing clearly, so the instruction could not be followed
  and the honest reading was "skip it". The two failure modes are not
  symmetric: loading a skill that turned out to be unnecessary costs a little
  context, and skipping one that carried the right endpoints, commands, or
  conventions produces a confidently wrong answer. The block now says so, asks
  the model to load on partial relevance, and — when only names are listed —
  states plainly that a name is not enough to rule a skill out.
- When the skills block does overflow its budget, the skills it drops are no
  longer chosen by load order, which always landed the cut on the skills an
  operator had installed. The cut now follows layer precedence, so `extra` and
  then `bundled` skills go before the ones in a writable skills path. The drop is
  also reported instead of being silent: a `skills_filter.budget_truncated`
  warning naming the dropped skills, and a `prompt_budget` reason on each
  affected skill.
- The skill count and skill-id list in turn metadata and the
  `skills_filter.applied` log counted skills that the budget had already thrown
  away, so the one place that could have revealed the problem asserted
  everything was fine.
- Setting an environment variable or installing a missing binary now takes
  effect for the agent without a gateway restart, which is what the
  Environment feature promised. The chat path built one eligibility cache at
  import time and remembered a *negative* lookup for the life of the process,
  while every other surface rebuilt its own per call — so the Skills screen
  reported a skill as ready while the agent refused to be given it, forever.
- Browsing or searching a skill hub now also shows skills you already installed
  from that source, including ones its catalog does not list. A skill installed
  from a GitHub URL used to vanish from the page it was installed on, because
  an empty browse never returned a row for it.
- The Installed marker in the community list no longer goes stale after a
  removal, and no longer fires on a catalog entry whose *name* happens to match
  an unrelated skill's install *identifier*. Names are matched against
  installed names and identifiers against installed identifiers.
- Installing a skill while a search is open no longer loses the row when the
  search is cleared, and the skill dialog no longer unmounts itself when the
  list underneath it changes.
- A failed hub search reports the failure instead of rendering as "no skills
  match your query", and results the hub matched on a tag are no longer
  discarded by a second client-side filter that could not see the tag.

## [2026.7.26] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Curated memory now nudges itself. Every N user turns — default 10,
  configured at `[memory.nudge]`, `interval = 0` disables it — a short
  background review runs after the reply is already on the wire and saves
  anything durable it found in the conversation. Machine traffic (cron,
  heartbeat, subagent, recall), the review turn itself, and turns where the
  agent already wrote to memory are excluded and do not advance the counter.
- OpenCAP is supported as an LLM gateway provider.
- Telegram shows a typing indicator while a turn is running.
- `SECURITY.md` documents GitHub private vulnerability reporting as the
  intake path for suspected vulnerabilities.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** channel authorization is now two connection surfaces —
  Control and Channel — backed by explicit RPC audiences, replacing roles and
  scopes. Telegram pairing is durable, group admission is explicit, and
  grants are revalidated before turns and tools. Owner/admin elevation is
  gone from tools, cron, the CLI, and the Control UI; sandbox and approval
  policy are unchanged. Channel roles, scoped tokens, access modes, and
  unauthenticated public Control are removed — existing configs using them
  need to move to pairing surfaces.
- Cron job management is scoped to the active profile, so jobs from one
  profile are no longer listed or mutated from another.
- Daily notes that the injection budget would discard are no longer read at
  all, cutting per-turn memory I/O.

### Fixed

- `/new` and `/reset` are non-destructive when flush is unavailable: the
  session is no longer discarded on a path that cannot produce a receipt,
  and compaction only demands a flush receipt when flush can actually
  produce one.
- The `MEMORY.md` migration is non-destructive — an existing file is
  preserved rather than overwritten.
- Turn captures are written atomically, so an interrupted write can no
  longer leave a truncated capture behind.
- Curated memory writes are locked on Windows, the injection scan covers a
  wider set of paths, and the hermes durability guards in the curated store
  are restored.
- `USER.md` counts as a memory source for write notifications.
- Unreadable curated files are surfaced as errors instead of being silently
  skipped, which previously left the agent blind to memory it could not
  read.
- The degraded-source list no longer grows one entry per failed metric.
- Slack dispatches Socket Mode slash commands and classifies slash-command
  conversations correctly.
- Discord completes native interaction responses and tolerates command
  registration failures instead of failing adapter startup.
- Telegram handles native bot-command mentions, preserves forum command
  reply targets, renders markdown replies, allows admitted DM slash
  commands, and keeps pairing runtime state serializable.
- Admitted senders are granted read access across channels.

### Removed

- Dream consolidation, the orphaned `flush_status`, the memory repair
  service, and the `agentos memory flush-session` command are removed.

## [2026.7.25] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- Added one fail-closed Control UI build contract,
  `python scripts/build_control_ui.py build`, for local source installs, CI,
  Docker, wheel/sdist publication, and wheelhouse releases. It requires
  Node.js 22 or newer, performs a clean locked npm install, enforces bundle
  budgets, generates an exact third-party license ledger, and verifies the
   resulting React bundle before packaging.
- OpenRouter's `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` is now the default LLM model.

### Changed

- The production Control UI is now the React 19 + Vite application on every
  route. Release wheels, source distributions, Docker images, and wheelhouse
  archives carry the same prebuilt, verified bundle; a missing or invalid
  bundle returns an actionable `503` instead of silently serving a different
  interface.
- Repository source builds and the provided source-install scripts now require
  Node.js 22 or newer and npm so they can build the Control UI before
  installing the Python package. Published wheels remain ready to run without
  Node.js.
- The SPA shell and runtime bootstrap are uncached while fingerprinted Vite
  assets are served with immutable caching. A runtime-injected base element
  lets one artifact serve `/control` and safe non-root custom prefixes,
  including deep-link refreshes; root, `/api`, and `/ws` prefixes are rejected
  because they overlap gateway routes.
- Guided setup and advanced configuration now share one Agent Setup workspace
  at `/control/settings`; the existing `/control/setup` and `/control/config`
  URLs remain compatibility routes, while adapter onboarding and credential
  validation now live with channel status and access management.
- Configuration clients now read one redacted `config.snapshot` and submit
  optimistic `expectedRevision` writes through a shared persist-first
  transaction. The gateway reports cumulative restart reasons, preserves
  write-only secret semantics, and provides explicit recovery when runtime and
  on-disk state diverge.

### Security

- The packaged Control UI now uses a same-origin Content Security Policy
  without `unsafe-inline` scripts. Theme initialization runs from a packaged
  pre-paint script; HTTP requests stay same-origin while explicit `ws:` and
  `wss:` remote-gateway profiles remain supported.
- Configuration snapshots never return stored secret values, and stale Control
  UI drafts fail closed when the active configuration changes on disk instead
  of overwriting an operator's out-of-band edit.

### Removed

- Retired the DingTalk, Matrix, QQ Bot, and WeCom channel adapters across the
  runtime, CLI, Web UI, configuration schema, install metadata, and current
  documentation. Supported messaging adapters are now Slack, Telegram, and
  Discord.
- Removed the retired Jinja Control UI template and its hand-maintained
  JavaScript, CSS, fonts, images, and vendored browser libraries. There is no
  legacy frontend fallback at runtime or in release artifacts.

### Fixed

- Control UI settings preserve the active configuration state, Bankr icons
  render correctly, and resetting a session reliably clears its client state.
- The collapsed Control UI sidebar toggle has improved interaction and layout.
- CLI onboarding prompts wrap correctly instead of overflowing narrow terminals.

## [2026.7.23] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- Mouse drag selection and copy in the full-screen `agentos chat` transcript:
  left-drag highlights text in the transcript pane and mouse-up copies the
  plain text (ANSI stripped, CJK width-aware) to the system clipboard via a
  cross-platform dispatcher (pbcopy, wl-copy, xclip, xsel, clip, OSC 52
  fallback) (#76).
- Rendering for reasoning-model think blocks in the CLI, with hidden tags and
  boundary markers so partial think content streams cleanly.

### Changed

- The waiting indicator is now turn-lifetime: it persists across the pre-token,
  mid-stream, and tool-call phases to give a consistent "agent is working"
  signal. `StreamingRenderer` uses the waiting indicator instead of a Rich
  `Live` instance, which removes ghost panel artifacts in Windows PowerShell.
- Markdown streaming keeps block and inline styles intact while preserving the
  raw buffer for downstream consumers.

### Fixed

- Telegram no longer deletes its persistent native command menu on adapter
  shutdown. Bot command menus are server-side configuration and must survive
  gateway restarts and overlapping adapter lifecycles (#74, fixes #52).

## [2026.7.22.post1] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Managed MCP server configuration in the Web UI, with stdio, SSE, and
  Streamable HTTP transports, OAuth authorization, dynamic tool discovery, a
  Robinhood Trading preset, and a bundled safety-focused Robinhood skill (#66).
- Mouse-wheel scrolling and Home/End and Ctrl+A/Ctrl+E line navigation in the
  full-screen `agentos chat` interface (#67).

### Changed

- Promoted the MCP SDK to a standard dependency so remote MCP integrations work
  without installing an optional extra (#71).
- Renamed the Web UI chat assistant label from `Cap` to `AGENTOS` (#73).

### Fixed

- `agentos chat` full-screen transcript now responds to the first mouse wheel
  tick instead of needing several scrolls before the pane moves: the wheel step
  is larger and the tick that releases follow mode is compensated so the
  wrapped-line cursor leaves the viewport immediately (#69).
- Unauthenticated OAuth MCP servers no longer connect during gateway startup;
  authenticated servers continue to reconnect automatically (#72).
- MCP cancellation cleanup now closes partial Streamable HTTP and discovery
  state so slow or unavailable remote servers cannot leave open AnyIO contexts
  or crash gateway startup (#71, #72).

## [2026.7.22] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- `tools.enabled = false` provides an explicit plain-text mode for Ollama and
  other models that do not reliably implement native tool calls.

### Fixed

- `agentos chat` input frame now supports multiline input instead of
  submitting on every `Enter` (#62).
- Ollama multi-turn tool conversations now preserve assistant tool calls,
  correlate tool results by name, normalize native arguments, and retain the
  provider's model and completion reason, preventing repeated searches caused
  by malformed replay history (#44).
- Channel slash commands now render their RPC results instead of returning a
  generic `/<command> completed` acknowledgement; `/help` and `/history` also
  request the correct catalog/history payloads.
- Telegram Bot API sends retry transient connection failures before reporting
  delivery failure.

## [2026.7.20] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- `agentos chat` UX pass (issue #46):
  - The assistant speaker label now defaults to `agentos` (was hard-coded
    `cap`); override with the `AGENTOS_ASSISTANT_LABEL` env var. The
    label is sourced from a single place and consumed by the streamed
    `◢` marker, the pre-token waiting row, and the queued-turn marker.
  - Session display name now surfaces in the bottom toolbar
    (`title · model · [tier:cN]`) and `/status`. `/new <title>` persists
    the title as `SessionNode.display_name` so it survives a later
    `/resume`. The standalone `/new` path no longer drops the title
    silently (pre-existing bug).
  - `/c0` … `/c3` and `/auto` are now registered on both CLI surfaces
    (`cli_gateway`, `cli_standalone`). Gateway mode reuses the existing
    `router.hold.set` / `router.hold.clear` RPCs; standalone mutates the
    in-process `RouterControlHoldStore` directly.
  - The active Pilot Router tier hold shows in the bottom toolbar and in
    `/status` (or `auto` when no hold is set).
  - `SessionNode.derived_title` property fills the pre-existing dead
    hook, falling back `display_name → label → short opaque session id`.
  - The startup panel now renders `Session: <title> (<key>)` when a
    friendly title is known (plumbed through `StartupData` and the
    gateway welcome notice).
  - The active input row is now framed by a top and bottom rule
    (Claude Code style) so the typing area reads as a distinct box
    between the transcript and the bottom toolbar. Consistent across the
    gateway and `--standalone` surfaces.
  - Full-screen chat surface is now the **default** for `agentos chat`: the
    conversation renders in a scrollable in-app pane above a permanently-pinned
    input frame, so the frame stays visible while the assistant streams (no
    flicker, no dropped partial lines). The branded welcome screen (connect
    line + banner + tool/skill panel) renders at the top of the pane on launch
    — previously it was wiped by the alternate screen buffer. `PgUp`/`PgDn`
    scroll history; new output re-pins to the tail. Non-TTY / piped
    invocations fall back to native scrollback; `AGENTOS_CHAT_FULLSCREEN=0`
    forces native scrollback and `=1` forces full-screen.

### Changed

- The bottom toolbar now leads with the session title (or short key
  fallback) instead of only the opaque key segment, and shows the model
  alias after it.

### Fixed

- The framed chat input no longer balloons to fill the screen on a fresh
  launch. The input buffer window is pinned to a single row
  (`Dimension.exact(1)`) and a greedy spacer heads the layout, so the
  compact frame + toolbar stay pinned to the bottom of the terminal
  instead of the bottom rule + toolbar being pushed far below the
  `◢ you` row.
- `test_assistant_label_env_override` no longer wipes the subprocess
  environment (`PATH=""`), which crashed Python startup on Windows CI
  (`import _overlapped` → `WinError 10106`); it now layers the override
  on a copy of `os.environ`.

## [2026.7.19.post1] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- Renamed the router display name from "AgentOS Router" to "Pilot Router"
  across the CLI, gateway, and onboarding surfaces.
- Synced the router docs with the `pilot-v1` default and the 3-option
  strategy selector.

### Removed

- The legacy `v4_phase3` router engine and its ~52MB model bundle no longer
  ship (Phase C): the module, the bundled weights, and the `lightgbm` /
  `joblib` / `scikit-learn` dependencies are gone from the wheel and the
  `recommended` / `ml-router` extras. A config that still pins
  `strategy = "v4_phase3"` keeps migrating to `pilot-v1` on load, and the
  removed `v4_bundle_dir` / `v4_use_aux_head` keys are ignored.

## [2026.7.19] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Bundled `agentos` self-operation skill so the agent can drive its own
  AgentOS CLI and gateway. (#37)

### Changed

- AgentOS Pilot (`pilot-v1`), the self-trained on-device English router, is now
  the default router strategy. (#26)
- Router strategy migration: persisted `v4_phase3` selections are force-migrated
  to `pilot-v1` at gateway boot, and `v4_phase3` is dropped from the
  human-facing onboarding and router selectors. (#36)
- Bankr skills browse source: limited to two curated skills to avoid GitHub rate
  limiting, filled the skill descriptions, and added a brand-glyph logo
  fallback, a 📺 emoji avatar fallback, and an "Update" button backed by the
  `skills.update` RPC. (#39, supersedes #35)

### Fixed

- Skills UI: the installed badge desynced between cards after an install and
  reverted to "not installed" after a page refresh — installed skills are now
  matched by both name and identifier. (#39)
- Skill browsing crashed on an explicit JSON `null` description returned from the
  GitHub/Clawhub search boundary; the description now defaults safely. (#39)
- Local single-provider setups keep self-consistent router tiers, and several
  local-provider degrade gaps were closed (vLLM handling, empty-model honesty,
  and log visibility). (#30)

## [2026.7.18.post1] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- Release-hygiene re-cut of 2026.7.18. The initial 2026.7.18 tag only bumped
  `pyproject.toml`, so the repo's release-consistency guards
  (`tests/test_release_consistency.py`, `tests/test_install_scripts.py`) failed
  and the install docs/scripts still pointed at the prior tag. This post-release
  propagates the version across `uv.lock`, both consistency tests, `RELEASES.md`,
  `CHANGELOG.md`, the README install examples, and `install.sh`/`install.ps1`.
  No runtime code changes — the distributed software is identical to 2026.7.18.

## [2026.7.18] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Interactive authentication provisioning when the gateway binds to a public
  interface: instead of refusing to start, `gateway start` now provisions a
  token interactively so a public bind is authenticated by default. `host` and
  `port` are configurable only via CLI flags (not runtime RPC). (#25)
- Browser-threat hardening for the gateway (#24). A loopback bind is not a
  boundary against a page in the operator's browser, so four fail-closed
  guards were added: a startup guard that refuses `auth.mode="none"` on a
  non-loopback bind (opt out with `auth.allow_unauthenticated_public=true`),
  WebSocket-handshake Origin validation (CSWSH), a `Host`-header allowlist
  (DNS rebinding), and an HTTP cross-origin guard on `/api/*`. Runtime
  `config.apply`/`config.patch` of `host` or `auth.mode` now reports
  `restartRequired: true`, since a host change does not rebind the live
  socket.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (opt-in deployments only):** the gateway now refuses to start
  when `auth.mode="none"` is combined with a non-loopback bind
  (`0.0.0.0`, a LAN IP, ...). If you deliberately run an unauthenticated
  gateway behind a reverse proxy / VPN / firewall, set
  `auth.allow_unauthenticated_public = true` (or
  `AGENTOS_AUTH_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_PUBLIC=true`). Default loopback
  deployments are unaffected. (#24)
- **BREAKING (opt-in deployments only):** `auth.mode="trusted-proxy"` no
  longer satisfies the public-bind guard. It only string-matched the
  client-suppliable `X-Forwarded-For` header (spoofable) and has no
  end-to-end resolver, so it did not actually authenticate. Use
  `auth.mode="token"` on public binds until real peer-IP validation ships.
  (#24)
- Reaching a loopback gateway through a custom hostname (e.g. an
  `/etc/hosts` alias to `127.0.0.1`) or a reverse-proxied Control UI now
  requires adding that origin to `control_ui.allowed_origins`; otherwise the
  `Host`/Origin guards reject it. The rejection message names the config key.
  (#24)

## [2026.7.17.post1] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- The `session_status` tool no longer fails on every call in a running
  gateway. It called `SessionManager.get_current_session()`, a method that
  exists only on test fakes and never on the production `SessionManager`, so
  the attribute access raised `AttributeError` and surfaced as
  `ToolError: Session manager not available`. It now resolves the calling
  session from the tool context — the same source the surrounding session
  tools already prefer — and loads it via `SessionManager.get_session()`.

## [2026.7.17] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Curated memory stores, embedding refresh, and a pluggable memory
  provider layer (mem0). (#17)
- Restored the missing v4_phase3 local ML router bundle so the default
  router runs on-device instead of pinning to a single class, and
  corrected its attribution to OpenSquilla upstream. (#19)

### Changed

- Redesigned the Web UI chat transcript. (#15)

### Fixed

- `agentos memory embedding-download` now follows Hugging Face's CDN
  redirects. Every `resolve/main/...` URL answers with a 302 to a signed
  Xet CDN URL, but `httpx` does not follow redirects by default, so the
  download aborted with an `HTTPStatusError` before writing any data and
  the command never worked against the live API. (#20)

## [2026.7.15.post1] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Partner-catalog skills system with a Bankr skills hub, and a
  Robinhood RWA address lookup skill (`robinhood-rwa-addresses`).

## [2026.7.15] - 2026-07-15

### Changed

- Relicensed the repository from MIT to **Apache-2.0** and added a root
  `NOTICE` file. Core modules derived from
  [OpenSquilla](https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla) (Apache-2.0)
  are now credited in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`; the README credits
  OpenSquilla (built on) plus OpenClaw and Hermes Agent (influences).
  Wheels now ship `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` in
  their dist-info license files.

## [2026.7.14.post1] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- The Python distribution is now published to PyPI as **`use-agent-os`**
  (`uv tool install "use-agent-os[recommended]"`). The import package
  (`import agentos`) and the `agentos` CLI are unchanged. PyPI's project-name
  similarity rules reject `agentos`/`agent-os` variants (the bare name is held
  by an unrelated, abandoned 2022 project), hence the org-matching name.
- Built wheels are named `use_agent_os-<version>-py3-none-any.whl` (PEP 427
  normalization). Install scripts, the wheelhouse builder, the release
  workflow, and the README now reference the new filename; the README's
  primary terminal install is the PyPI command instead of a pinned wheel URL.

## [2026.7.14] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- Re-release aligning the current version tag to 2026.7.14.
- Adopted CalVer versioning (`YYYY.M.D`). Because PEP 440 normalizes the version
  segment in wheel filenames (leading zeros dropped), tags use the same
  non-padded form, e.g. `v2026.7.15`.
- Install docs outside the README (`README.product.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`,
  `docs/mcp-server.md`, `docs/operations.md`) now point to the canonical README
  Installation section instead of duplicating version-pinned wheel URLs.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-07-05

Initial release of AgentOS.

### Core

- `agentos` Python package with the `agentos` and `gateway` CLI entry points.
- Unified gateway: one local Starlette server (`127.0.0.1:18791`) drives a
  single `TurnRunner` engine shared by the Web UI, the CLI, and every chat
  channel (Slack, Telegram, Discord, DingTalk, WeCom, Matrix, QQ). Tool
  calls, retries, approvals, and logs behave the same on every surface.
- Durable sessions, chat history, and replay data persisted in SQLite, with a
  per-agent workspace folder and bounded-depth subagents.

### Pilot Router

- Pilot Router picks the cheapest capable model tier (c0–c3) for each turn.
  The default `recommended` install ships the router; `AGENTOS_INSTALL_PROFILE=core`
  or `--router disabled` turns it off and routes every turn to one model.
- Two selectable routing strategies. The default `v4_phase3` runs an on-device
  ML ensemble (BGE embeddings + LightGBM) that scores each turn locally with no
  LLM call; the `recommended` / `ml-router` extras install its runtime
  dependencies. Its ~75MB model bundle is kept out of git and is not
  distributed with the repo or the wheel in this release, so unless the bundle
  is restored locally the router degrades gracefully — it logs a warning at
  boot and pins every turn to the default tier. The alternative `llm_judge`
  strategy classifies each turn (R0–R3) via a small LLM call — a cloud model or
  a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama / LM Studio / llama.cpp / vLLM)
  set with `judge_model` / `judge_base_url` — and needs no local model files.
- Onboarding (Web UI wizard and CLI) offers the strategy via the Mode dropdown —
  "Pilot Router (Local ML)", "Pilot Router (LLM Judge)", or "Disabled". The
  "Judge model" field applies to, and appears only for, the LLM Judge strategy.
- `/c0`–`/c3` slash commands (web chat and messaging channels) pin the router
  to a tier for the current session; `/auto` restores automatic routing. These
  share the same short-lived hold store as the LLM-facing `router_control`
  tool via the `router.hold.set` / `router.hold.clear` gateway RPCs.
- The router auto-select visualisation mounts in a dock directly below the
  chat input bar and shows the latest turn's routing state.

### Providers

- Talks to 20+ LLM providers behind one config. **OpenRouter** is the default
  (`llm.provider = "openrouter"`, base URL `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`,
  env `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`). The **Bankr LLM Gateway**
  (`https://llm.bankr.bot/v1`, env `BANKR_API_KEY`) is a selectable
  OpenAI-compatible gateway with its own tier profile. OpenAI, Anthropic,
  Ollama, DeepSeek, Gemini, DashScope/Qwen, Moonshot AI, Zhipu, Baidu Qianfan,
  and Volcengine Ark are also onboarding-verified.
- Model catalogs are fetched live from the provider's public endpoint at boot
  (context window, max output, vision support), with a hardcoded static
  fallback retained for offline boots.
- The `/model` slash command lists available models (name, id, provider,
  context window) across the TUI, web chat, and channel surfaces, with an
  optional `/model <filter>` substring filter.

### Tools, skills, and memory

- MCP-native tools and 37 bundled skills (coding, GitHub, cron, pptx/docx/xlsx/pdf,
  summaries, tmux, weather, and more) that load only when a task needs them.
  AgentOS can consume other MCP servers and expose itself as one
  (`agentos mcp-server run`, `mcp` extra).
- Persistent local memory: a `MEMORY.md` file plus dated Markdown notes,
  searchable by keyword (SQLite FTS) or meaning (`sqlite-vec`). Semantic recall
  runs on-device via a bundled BGE ONNX embedding model
  (`src/agentos/memory/models/bge_onnx/`), or can defer to OpenAI / Ollama.
- Built-in web search (Brave or DuckDuckGo) with SSRF-safe page fetching,
  document generation (PPTX/DOCX/PDF), image generation, and text-to-speech.

### Security and operations

- Layered security sandbox with three levels (Standard, Strict, Locked):
  Bubblewrap on Linux, `sandbox-exec` (Seatbelt) on macOS. Repeated denials
  auto-pause the agent; blocked output and tool results are sanitized so they
  cannot steer the model.
- Operator controls: human approval for risky tool calls, per-turn and
  per-session token/cost accounting (`agentos cost`), and diagnostics from both
  the CLI and Web UI (`agentos doctor`, the Web UI Health page).
- A `SchedulerEngine` with a built-in cron reader runs jobs via `agentos cron`.
- Config is auto-discovered (`AGENTOS_GATEWAY_CONFIG_PATH` → `./agentos.toml`
  → `~/.agentos/config.toml` → built-in defaults); environment-variable secrets
  always win over file values.
- One-way import from OpenClaw (`~/.openclaw`) and Hermes Agent (`~/.hermes`)
  via `agentos migrate`, with dry-run reports before applying.

### Brand and contribution

- Brand identity: the AgentOS wordmark and molecule mark.
- Plain pull-request contribution flow targeting `main`; relicensed to MIT.
